## `@autobe/rpc`
RPC module of `@autobe` for WebSocket Communication.

If you are considering to make an `@autobe` based service, WebSocket protocol is essentially required. Chatting application is basically a two-way communication. AI chatbot is also a two-way chat between an user and an assistant, based on events. Therefore, it cannot be a one-way communication HTTP Restful API, and a two-way protocol such as WebSocket is required.

However, don't be afraid of WebSocket application development. Below is the example codes of WebSocket application development utilizing `@autobe/rpc` in both client and server side. Look at the example codes, and feel how easy and type-safe it is.

## Setup
### NodeJS Server
<AutoBeRpcNodeJsSetupSnippet />

To develop NodeJS WebSocket server of `@autobe`, you need to install these packages.

At first, install `@autobe/agent`, `@autobe/compiler` and `@autobe/interface` packages, which are required for chatbot. And then, install `@autobe/rpc` and [`tgrid`](https://tgrid.com) packages. 

`tgrid` is a TypeScript based RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework supporting WebSocket protocol, and `@autobe/rpc` is a wrapper module of `@autobe/agent` following the WebSocket RPC.

### NestJS Server
<AutoBeRpcNestJsSetupSnippet />

Install NestJS and `@autobe` packages, and then setup `nestia`.

[`@nestia`](https://nestia.io) is a set of helper libraries for NestJS, and it supports WebSocket protocol that is following the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) paradigm.

### Client Application
<AutoBeRpcClientSetupSnippet />

Just install `@autobe/rpc`, `tgrid` packages.




## Remote Procedure Call

box Client Application

  participant Connector as Communicator (Client)
end
box Server Application
  participant Acceptor as Communicator (Server)
  actor Provider
end
User->>Driver: 1. calls a function
Activate User
Activate Driver
Driver->>Connector: 2. delivers the function call
Activate Connector

Connector-->>Acceptor: 3. sends a protocolized<br/>network message<br/>meaning a function call
Deactivate Connector
Activate Acceptor
Acceptor->>Provider: 4. calls the function
Provider->>Acceptor: 5. returns a value
Acceptor-->>Connector: 6. sends a protocolized<br/>network message<br/>meaning a return value
Deactivate Acceptor
Activate Connector
Connector->>Driver: 7. delivers the return value
Deactivate Connector
Activate Driver
Driver->>User: 8. returns the value
Deactivate Driver
Deactivate User
```

WebSocket protocol with RPC paradigm for `@autobe`.

### Header
Header value delivered from client to server after the connection.

In [`TGrid`](https://tgrid.com)'s RPC (Remote Procedure Call) paradigm, header means a value that is delivered after the connection from a client to the server. And header is used in most cases to authenticate the connecting client.

In the above example project, `IAuthorizationHeader` is the header type, and is used by server to determine whether to accept the client's connection or not. If the client's header is not valid, the server would reject the connection.

### Provider
Functions provided from remote system.

Provider is an object instance containing some functions provided for the remote system for RPC (Remote Procedure Call). In many cases, the provide becomes a class instance containing some methods to be called, but it is okay that composing the provider by just an interface type.

Also, the opposite remote system will call provider's functions by the [`Driver<Remote>`](#driver) instance. In the above example, client application is providing `IAutoBeRpcListener` to the server, and server is providing `AutoBeRpcService` (`IAutoBeRpcService`) to the client.

### Driver
Driver of RPC (Remote Procedure Call).

`Driver` is a proxy instance designed to call functions of the remote system. It has a generic argument `Remote` which means the type of remote system's [Provider](#provider), and you can remotely call the functions of the [Provider](#provider) asynchronously through the `Drive<Remote>` instance.

When you call some function of remote [Provider](#provider) by the `Driver<Listener>` instance, it hooks the function call expression, and delivers the function name and arguments (parameter values) to the remote system through the [Communicator](#communicator). If the remote system succeeded to reply the result of the function call, [Communicator](#communicator) resolves the promise of the function call expression with the result, so that makes `Driver<Remote>` working.

In the above example, client application is calling `IAutoBeRpcService.conversate()` function remotely through the `Driver<IAutoBeRpcService>` typed instance. In that case, `IAutoBeRpcService` is the [Provider](#provider) instance from server to client.
