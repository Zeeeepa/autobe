import AutoBePlaygroundSection from "../../template/AutoBePlaygroundSection.mdx";

## Playground

<AutoBePlaygroundSection />

## Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wrtnlabs/autobe
cd autobe
pnpm install
pnpm run playground
```

You can setup playground like application on your local machine.

Clone this `@autobe` repository and run the `playground` script after installing dependencies with `pnpm install`. This will start a local server that you can access to interact with the `@autobe` agent.

## WebSocket Server

```typescript
import { AutoBeAgent } from "@autobe/agent";
import { AutoBePlaygroundServer }  from "@autobe/playground-server";
import { AutoBeCompiler } from "@autobe/compiler";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const server = new AutoBePlaygroundServer({
  predicate: async (acceptor) => {
    return {
      type: "accept",
      agent: new AutoBeAgent({
        vendor: {
          api: new OpenAI({ apiKey: "********" }),
          model: "gpt-4.1",
        },
        model: "chatgpt",
        compiler: new AutoBeCompiler(),
      }),
      cwd: `${__dirname}/../playground-result`,
    }
  },
});
await server.listen(3_000);
```

You can serve the `@autobe` agent as a WebSocket server like above.
