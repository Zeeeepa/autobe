We want to ask backend developers: Can AI truly replace the work of backend developers? We seek to hear the answer to this question directly from developers working in the field.

AutoBE is an AI-based no-code platform that automatically generates backend applications through natural language conversations. When you discuss requirements with AutoBE's AI chatbot, AutoBE organizes them into a requirements specification, designs database schemas, defines APIs, writes test code, and ultimately implements a backend application that successfully builds. But is the generated code truly production-ready? Perhaps it's just seemingly plausible code fragments that differ from what users actually want?

This hackathon is designed precisely to validate this point. We expect developers with actual backend development experience to use AutoBE firsthand and provide honest, sharp evaluations from an expert perspective. Please tell us whether the backend applications generated by AutoBE truly match what you wanted. Your critical perspective and professional analysis will play a crucial role in developing AutoBE into a better tool.

### 1.1. Target Participants

**Who We're Looking For**

This hackathon is open to developers with **at least 1 year of practical backend development experience**.

We need developers who can:
- Not only write code but also distinguish between good and bad code
- Evaluate architectural pros and cons
- Provide realistic feedback based on actual service operation experience

**We Particularly Welcome**
- Those with deep insights into the limitations and possibilities of AI code generation tools
- Those who have considered how emerging development paradigms will impact the developer community
- Those who can objectively evaluate new technologies based on their expertise

### 1.2. Event Information

**Timeline**
- **Registration**: September 5 - 10, 2025
- **Hackathon Duration**: 64 hours (2 days and 16 hours)
  - **Start**: September 12, 08:00:00 (PDT, UTC-7)
  - **End**: September 14, 23:59:59 (PDT, UTC-7)



**Prize Pool: $6,400**
- **Best Review**: $2,000
- **Second Best Review**: $1,000
- **Participation Prize**: $50 (for all who provide meaningful feedback)


### 1.3. Next Hackathon Preview

**Why Only 70 Participants?**

This 1st hackathon is limited to **70 participants** on a first-come, first-served basis. The main reason for this limitation is AI token usage costs.

**Current Situation**
- AutoBE has focused on unit implementation and testing
- High-quality backend applications can be generated
- However, AI token usage optimization (RAG) is not yet implemented

**Token Usage Example**
- Large-scale e-commerce platform: ~150 million tokens
- Cost: Approximately **$300** per generation
- With hundreds of participants, costs would be prohibitive

> **Good News!**
>
> In the next hackathon, we'll introduce RAG technology to dramatically reduce token usage and prepare a grand event where many more developers can participate. This hackathon is the first step.

## 2. What is AutoBE?

**AutoBE is a vibe coding agent for building backend applications, enhanced with AI-friendly compilers.**

- [Github Repository](https://github.com/wrtnlabs/autobe)
- [Guide Documents](https://autobe.dev/docs)

**Key Innovation**

AutoBE is an AI-based no-code backend generation platform that creates fully functional production-grade backend applications from natural language requirements alone.

To solve the fundamental limitation of existing AI code generation tools - that generated code often doesn't compile or run - we introduced an innovative approach called **Compiler-in-the-Loop**.

**Core Achievement**

A vibe coding agent exclusively for backend application generation with **100% build success rate** (based on OpenAI GPT 4.1) - that's AutoBE.

### 2.1. How It Works

<AutoBeWaterfallDiagram />

AutoBE follows a **5-stage process** that reinterprets the traditional software engineering waterfall model for the AI era. Each stage is handled by specialized AI agents, with compilers performing real-time validation at every stage.

#### Stage 1: Analyze Agent
**Requirements Analysis**
- Systematically analyzes requirements entered in natural language
- Understands business logic, not just listing features
- Derives various user personas and defines permissions/roles
- Identifies and clarifies ambiguous or conflicting requirements

#### Stage 2: Prisma Agent
**Database Schema Design**
- Designs database schemas based on requirements
- Identifies relationships between entities
- Applies appropriate normalization
- Establishes indexing strategies
- Generates type-safe data models validated by Prisma compiler


#### Stage 3: Interface Agent
**API Design**
- Designs RESTful APIs
- Defines HTTP methods, URIs, and request/response formats
- Generates complete API documentation (OpenAPI 3.1)
- Must pass AutoBE-specific OpenAPI compiler


#### Stage 4: Test Agent
**E2E Test Generation**
- Writes E2E test code
- Creates test scenarios simulating actual user behavior
- Includes normal cases, edge cases, and error situations
- Test code must be executable and validated by test runner


#### Stage 5: Realize Agent
**Implementation**
- Implements actual backend code
- Based on NestJS framework
- Implements controller, service, and repository layers
- Handles dependency injection, middleware, and guards
- Must pass TypeScript compiler and NestJS builder


### 2.2. Technical Features

AutoBE's most distinctive feature is the integration of specialized compilers at each stage. They validate in real-time whether AI-generated code is syntactically correct, type-consistent, and actually executable.

**Compiler-in-the-Loop Process**
1. AI generates code
2. Compiler validates the code
3. If errors occur, AI receives feedback
4. AI modifies the code
5. Repeat until complete code is generated

#### AI-Specific Compilers

AutoBE's core competitive advantage lies in the AI-specific compilers independently developed for Prisma, Interface, and Test domains. Unlike general development tools, these compilers deeply understand and are optimized for AI characteristics:

**AI-specific Prisma Compiler**
- Goes beyond simply validating schema syntax
- Evaluates logical consistency and relationship appropriateness
- Preemptively detects circular references or duplicate relationships
- Provides AI-understandable feedback

**AI-specific Interface Compiler**
- Validates OpenAPI 3.1 spec compliance
- Checks RESTful principle adherence
- Ensures consistency between endpoints
- Detects missing authentication headers or error formats


**AI-specific Test Compiler**
- Analyzes whether test code performs meaningful validation
- Evaluates test coverage and edge case inclusion
- Assesses realism of test scenarios
- Suggests improvement directions to AI


> **Key Differentiator**
>
> While regular compilers simply say "there's an error," AutoBE's compilers provide detailed feedback on "why it's a problem" and "how to fix it" in a way AI can understand. This close collaboration is the secret to 100% build success rate.

#### AST-Based Code Generation

Another innovation of AutoBE is its structured code generation approach based on **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)**.


**How It Works**
1. AI analyzes natural language requirements
2. AI generates data through function calling
3. Data follows predefined AST structures
4. AI "assembles" code rather than "writes" it
5. Generated AST is validated by compilers
6. AST is converted into actual usable code


**Check AST Structures on GitHub:**
- **Prisma Compiler**: [`AutoBePrisma.IApplication`](https://github.com/wrtnlabs/autobe/blob/main/packages/interface/src/prisma/AutoBePrisma.ts)
- **Interface Compiler**: [`AutoBeOpenApi.IDocument`](https://github.com/wrtnlabs/autobe/blob/main/packages/interface/src/openapi/AutoBeOpenApi.ts) 
- **Test Compiler**: [`AutoBeTest.IFunction`](https://github.com/wrtnlabs/autobe/blob/main/packages/interface/src/test/AutoBeTest.ts)

#### Technology Stack


**Modern, Proven Technologies**
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: NestJS
- **ORM**: Prisma
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/SQLite

Generated code follows the same standards used in actual production environments.


### 2.3. Live Demonstration

We've prepared actual backend applications generated by AutoBE to prove its capabilities. These aren't prototypes or demosâ€”they're fully functional production-grade applications created entirely through natural language conversations.

   - [AI Review](https://github.com/wrtnlabs/autobe-example-shopping/tree/main/AI_REVIEW.md)


#### How Simple Is It?

The process is remarkably simple. Creating a discussion board with AutoBE requires just five natural language commands. No coding knowledge, no technical jargonâ€”just describe what you want:

**Example: Creating a Discussion Board**

1. I want to create a political/economic discussion board. Since I'm not familiar with programming, please write a requirements analysis report as you see fit.
2. Design the database schema.
3. Create the API interface specification.
4. Make the e2e test functions.
5. Implement API functions.

That's it. In about 70 minutes, you'll have a complete backend application ready to deploy. This isn't theoryâ€”it's how we generated all the examples above.

> [!TIP] 
>
> **For Hackathon Participants**
>
> Yes, these demo prompts are ridiculously simple. But during the hackathon, please don't just say "do everything by yourself!" 
>
> Actually discuss your requirements in detail with the AI. The better your input, the better your output will be.


## 3. Purpose of the Hackathon

**The Big Question**

AutoBE seems theoretically perfect. It has all the elements:
- Systematic processes
- Compiler validation
- Modern technology stack
- Code that compiles, runs, and passes tests

**But we still don't have an answer to one important question:**

### Is the backend application generated by AutoBE really what users wanted?

**Our Current Validation**

Until now, our development team has focused on whether each component of AutoBE works correctly:
- Compilers perform accurate validation
- Agents generate appropriate code
- The entire system operates stably

But these were all validations from a technical perspective.

**What We Need to Know**

In actual development fields, there are things as important as technical completeness:

- Is the generated code easy to maintain?
- Is the architecture scalable?
- Is performance optimization appropriate?
- Are there security vulnerabilities?
- Above all, is it "good code" from a developer's perspective?

> **Why Human Evaluation Matters**
>
> To answer these questions, we need evaluations from experts with actual backend development experience. While automated code review through AI is possible, we trust insights from human intuition and experience more.
>
> Especially evaluations from the perspective of **"What if I had to take over this code?"** can only be done by actual developers.

### 3.1. What We Want to Hear

**We Want Specific, Practical Feedback**

Not simple praise or criticism, but detailed analysis:

- **Requirements Specifications**: How do they compare to those used in actual projects?
- **Database Design**: Is it reasonable for long-term use?
- **API Design**: Does it properly follow RESTful principles?
- **Test Code**: Does it perform meaningful validation?
- **Implementation Code**: Does it have production-level quality?


**We're Also Curious About**

- How does AutoBE's generated code differ from what you would write yourself?
- What's better? What's lacking?
- What direction should we take for improvement?


> **Most Important**
>
> We expect your honest evaluation on whether AutoBE is truly a tool that can improve developer productivity or merely an interesting technical demo.
