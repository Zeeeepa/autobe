> A 70-year-old grandmother who grows tomatoes in the countryside created an online debate website in just 10 minutes. Despite being unfamiliar with coding or computers, she built this current affairs and [economics discussion community](https://github.dev/wrtnlabs/autobe-example-bbs) simply by talking with Wrtn's AI. What's remarkable is that users can write posts and comments entirely through voice commands and even engage in current affairs debates with AI.
>
> The next day, the grandmother spent another 20 minutes launching an [agricultural products shopping mall](https://github.dev/wrtnlabs/autobe-example-shopping). Customers can simply say "I'd like to order 2kg of tomatoes" to complete their purchase, while the grandmother manages everything from orders and shipping to inventory through simple chat conversations.

This is the vision that we, the [WrtnLabs](https://github.com/wrtnlabs) team, are pursuing. We aim to create a world where anyone can build backend servers, AI chatbots, and frontend applications without any coding knowledgeâ€”simply by conversing with AI.

To realize this vision, the [WrtnLabs](https://github.com/wrtnlabs) team is developing two additional projects: [`@agentica`](https://github.com/wrtnlabs/agentica) and [`@autoview`](https://github.com/wrtnlabs/autoview).

- **`@agentica`**: Automatically creates AI chatbots when you provide a `swagger.json` file
- **`@autoview`**: Automatically generates frontend applications when you provide a `swagger.json` file

You're not limited to just creating backends with `@autobe`. Once you've built a no-code backend application through `@autobe`, you can immediately create an AI chatbot and frontend applications alongside it.

Can you converse? Then you're a full-stack developer.
