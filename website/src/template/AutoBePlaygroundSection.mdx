Experience the `@autobe` agent through our interactive playground above.

To see examples of backend applications generated by `@autobe`, explore these interactive demos. These showcase `@autobe`'s ability to generate production-ready backend code with proper structure, API documentation, and TypeScript interfaces. If you're unsure what to try, start with the BBS example script below.

- [BBS (Bulletin Board System)](https://github.dev/wrtnlabs/autobe-example-bbs)
  1. I want to create a political/economic discussion board. Since I'm not familiar with programming, please write a requirements analysis report as you see fit.
  2. Design the database schema.
  3. Create the API interface specification.
  4. Make the e2e test functions.
- [E-Commerce](https://github.dev/wrtnlabs/autobe-example-shopping)

If you want to run `@autobe` on your local machine (for using Local LLMs or when the playground website isn't working), you can set it up with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wrtnlabs/autobe
cd autobe
pnpm install
pnpm run playground
```
