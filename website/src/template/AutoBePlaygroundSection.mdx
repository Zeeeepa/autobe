Clone the repository and run the playground application locally. This allows you to chat with the `@autobe` agent, manage multiple sessions, and use various LLM providers including local models.

After installation, the playground will be available at http://localhost:5713. You can interact with AutoBE through a chat interface - simply describe what you want to build, and AutoBE will generate the backend application for you.

If you're unsure what to try, start with this example script to create a political/economic discussion board:

1. I want to create a political/economic discussion board. Since I'm not familiar with programming, please write a requirements analysis report as you see fit.
2. Design the database schema.
3. Create the API interface specification.
4. Make the e2e test functions.
5. Implement API functions.
