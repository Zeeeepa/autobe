Experience the `@autobe` agent through our interactive playground above.

The current alpha version of `@autobe` supports up to the [Interface](#interface) step, with full features planned for the beta release. In the official release, you'll be able to experience full-stack development by integrating with [`@agentica`](https://github.com/wrtnlabs/agentica) and [`@autoview`](https://github.com/wrtnlabs/autoview).

To see examples of backend applications generated by `@autobe`, explore these interactive demos. These showcase `@autobe`'s ability to generate production-ready backend code with proper structure, API documentation, and TypeScript interfaces. If you're unsure what to try, start with the BBS example script below.

- [BBS (Bulletin Board System)](https://stackblitz.com/github/wrtnlabs/autobe-example-bbs)
  1. I want to create a political/economic discussion board. Since I'm not familiar with programming, please write a requirements analysis report as you see fit.
  2. Design the database schema.
  3. Create the API interface specification.
