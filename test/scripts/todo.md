I want to create a multi-user Todo list application. Users should be able to register and log in to the service, and manage their own personal todo lists. Each user's todo list must be private and inaccessible to other users.

For the core Todo functionality, I only need the essential features - keeping it minimal and simple. However, please include complete user authentication and authorization features to ensure proper user separation.

Since I'm not familiar with programming, please analyze these requirements and create a detailed requirements specification document as you see fit, including any technical decisions and assumptions you need to make.
