I want to create an e-commerce shopping mall platform.

Since I'm not familiar with programming, please write a requirements analysis report as you see fit.

Here are the key features I want:
- User registration and login with address management
- Product catalog with categories and search
- Product variants (SKU) with different colors, sizes, options
- Shopping cart and wishlist
- Order placement and payment processing
- Order tracking and shipping status updates
- Product reviews and ratings
- Seller accounts to manage their products
- Inventory management per SKU
- Order history and cancellation/refund requests
- Admin dashboard for order and product management
