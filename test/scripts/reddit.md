I want to create a Reddit-like community platform.

Since I'm not familiar with programming, please write a requirements analysis report as you see fit.

Here are the key features I want:
- User registration and login
- Create communities (subreddits)
- Post text, links, or images in communities
- Upvote/downvote posts and comments
- Comment on posts with nested replies
- User karma system
- Sort posts by hot, new, top, controversial
- Subscribe to communities
- User profiles showing their posts and comments
- Report inappropriate content
