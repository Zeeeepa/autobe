I want to create a modern economic discussion platform like Reddit for professionals.

MUST HAVE:
- User profiles with expertise verification
- Bookmark/save posts, view my voting history
- Advanced search (trending, expert-level, date range)
- Poll/survey features for economic sentiment
- Real-time notifications and live discussions
- Draft saving for long posts
- Follow users and subscribe to topics
- Reputation system based on quality contributions

Build a platform that matches modern social media UX while maintaining professional discussion quality.
