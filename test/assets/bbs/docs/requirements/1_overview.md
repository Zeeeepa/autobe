# 1. Overview: Internal Bulletin Board System

## 1.1 Background and Context

Modern organizations require a reliable, secure, and user-friendly communication platform to foster information sharing, encourage employee engagement, and streamline official notices. Traditional communication channels—such as emails or chat—often lack structure, are hard to track for organization-wide messages, and may introduce security, privacy, or discoverability concerns. An **Internal Bulletin Board System (IBBS)** addresses these gaps by centralizing announcements, facilitating open discussions, and supporting company-wide engagement in one auditable environment.

## 1.2 Purpose of the System

The Internal Bulletin Board System is designed to:
- Serve as the authoritative platform for company announcements, discussions, and informal posts
- Ensure only authorized members (employees) can view and participate
- Encourage collaboration and exchange of ideas across hierarchical and departmental boundaries
- Allow tracking of popular content, ensuring important or trending posts gain sufficient visibility

## 1.3 Scope

The IBBS project encompasses:
- **Announcement Board**: For official company notices
- **Free Board**: For open, informal employee discussions or knowledge sharing
- **Popular Board**: Automatically populated with posts achieving a high level of engagement (as defined by likes)

Core features include:
- Secure authentication with company email and password
- Role-based access (author, admin)
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for posts and comments, including like functionality
- User-friendly navigation with dedicated UI/UX standards
- Hard delete for content removal with no retention
- Server-side duplicate action (like) protection

## 1.4 Strategic Value

Deploying this Internal Bulletin Board System will:
- Foster culture, transparency, and knowledge sharing
- Offer persistent documentation for key updates and conversations
- Streamline communication flows, reducing email noise
- Boost employee participation via recognizable, interactive content mechanisms (likes, replies)
- Strengthen internal communications security, as only authenticated users can access data

## 1.5 Out-of-Scope (Initial Release)

The following are not part of the current scope but may be considered in future releases:
- Advanced file attachment support or media embedding
- Multi-level (deep) nested comment threads
- Integration with external tools (e.g., Slack, Teams)
- Analytics dashboard for engagement metrics beyond "Popular Board"
