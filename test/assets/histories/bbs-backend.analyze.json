The goal is to guide development of comprehensive functionalities, robust moderation, and intuitive administration.\n\n## Representative User Journeys\n\n### 1. Member Journey\n#### Scenario: Account Creation to Discussion Participation\n1. **Registration & Email Verification:** User signs up, receives a verification email, completes the process. Edge Case: User requests password reset during registration; system prompts secure reset flow.\n2. **Profile Setup:** User adds profile info, sets notification preferences.\n3. **Browsing Boards:** Member views categories, sorts posts by recency or popularity.\n4. **Creating a Post:** The member writes a topic, selects a board, and submits. Immediate preview is shown; validation errors trigger inline feedback.\n5. **Commenting/Reacting:** The member posts comments, upvotes, or downvotes. Edge Case: Member tries to edit/delete after a set period; system restricts with guidance.\n6. **Password Recovery:** Forgotten password triggers secure reset via verified email, with rate limiting for security.\n\n### 2. Moderator Journey\n#### Scenario: Issue Detection to Resolution\n1. **Content Monitoring:** Moderator reviews flagged posts/comments via dashboard with filtering and real-time alerts.\n2. **Action Workflow:** Edits inappropriate content, deletes spam, or bans users temporarily. Edge Case: Member appeals a ban—moderator reviews activity logs before responding.\n3. **Escalation Path:** For severe or repeated violations, moderator forwards user/report to admin for permanent ban review.\n\n### 3. Admin Journey\n#### Scenario: Platform Management\n1. **User & Role Administration:** Admin adds or removes members/moderators, updates roles, and resets user credentials securely.\n2. **Board Configuration:** Creates new boards/categories, changes board settings (visibility, access, rules).\n3. **System Settings:** Updates platform-wide settings, such as registration policies, analytics preferences.\n\n## Analytics Use Cases\n\n- **User Engagement Analytics:** Track DAU/WAU (daily/weekly active users), unique posters/commenters, and time spent per board. Dashboards offer line charts (time series for posts/comments), heatmaps (peak activity by hour/day), and cohort analysis (engagement by registration period).\n   - *Example:* Trending topics are visualized, enabling moderators/admins to identify community interests and preemptively moderate heated topics. \n- **Moderation Metrics:** Reports on number/ratio of post deletions, bans issued, appeal success rates, and response times. Bar graphs compare moderator intervention rates by topic or time.\n   - *Example:* Admins filter analytics by moderator to review effectiveness or possible inconsistencies in enforcement.\n- **Content Quality Analysis:** Machine learning surfaces posts flagged as low-quality or potentially harmful, with drill-downs for moderators. Edge Case: Sudden spike in reports triggers automated alerts and escalates review priority.\n\n## Roles and Permissions for Discussion Board\n\n| Role       | Key Permissions                                                   | Sample Workflow Example                                            |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Member     | Register, log in, create/read/edit/delete own posts/comments, vote| Post a question -> Edit for clarity -> Delete after answer is accepted. Edge Case: Attempts to delete after comment period expired results in error message with info on moderation contact. |\n| Moderator  | All member rights plus edit/delete any post, ban users, view reports| Receives alert -> Reviews reported comment -> Edits inappropriate language -> Temporarily bans offender. Edge Case: Receives mass reporting of a post, reviews abuse detection, escalates to admin if pattern persists. |\n| Admin      | All moderator rights plus user/role admin, board config, system settings| Adds new moderator -> Reviews effectiveness via analytics -> Modifies board rules based on trend data. Edge Case: During appeals, reviews all logs and reverses a mistaken ban, with automated member notification. |\n\n## Edge Cases and Rare Journeys\n- **Forgotten Password Recovery:** User fails multiple attempts; account lock is triggered, manual admin unlock workflow is required.\n- **Ban Appeal:** Member submits appeal request; system routes to designated moderator; resolution is tracked for audit.\n- **Escalation:** Persistent violators or automated anomaly detection flags a user for admin review, triggering investigation and possible platform-wide actions.\n\n---\n\nFor full requirements, refer to the [Table of Contents](./00_toc_discussionboard.md).","03_roles_and_permissions_discussionboard.md":"# Roles and Permissions for Discussion Board\n\nThis document outlines the roles, permissions, and access control strategies for the Discussion Board platform. It provides developers with concrete reference for user role assignments, permission validation, escalation logic, and example flows to ensure consistent standards across all features.\n\n## 1. Role Definitions\n\n### Member\n- **Capabilities:**\n  - Register, authenticate, and log in.\n  - View published boards and topics.\n  - Create new discussion topics.\n  - Comment on existing topics.\n  - Like, upvote, or downvote posts and comments.\n- **Restrictions:**\n  - Cannot access moderation functions.\n  - No ability to suspend or ban users.\n  - Limited configuration or board management rights.\n  - Cannot escalate privileges without explicit admin assignment.\n\n**Example:** Alice, an active community user, registers, logs in, joins a sports discussion, posts a new topic about the Olympics, comments on other threads, and upvotes insightful responses.\n\n### Moderator\n- **Capabilities (In addition to Member):**\n  - Edit or delete any post or comment (not just own).\n  - Manage reported content (review, modify, or remove infringing posts).\n  - Temporarily suspend or ban members who violate guidelines.\n- **Restrictions:**\n  - Cannot manage overall user accounts or assign system-wide roles.\n  - Cannot modify system or board settings.\n  - Cannot assign or remove moderator/admin roles.\n\n**Example:** John, a trusted community volunteer, flags and removes multiple spam posts and temporarily bans an abusive member for 24 hours, all via the moderator control panel.\n\n### Admin\n- **Capabilities (Full privileges):**\n  - Execute all functions of moderator and member roles.\n  - System-wide user management (activation, deactivation, deletion).\n  - Configure board settings, structure, and categories.\n  - Assign or revoke user, moderator, or admin roles.\n  - Access audit logs and change system-wide settings.\n- **Restrictions:**\n  - Accountability to audit and governance policies.\n  - All actions should be logged; some irreversible operations may require confirmation.\n\n**Example:** Maria, the platform administrator, restructures the entire board, promotes two moderators, adjusts voting algorithms, and exports user logs for compliance.\n\n## 2. Permissions Matrix\n\n| Role      | View Posts | Create Post | Comment | Like/Vote | Edit/Delete Others | Manage Reports | Ban Users | Manage Users | Assign Roles | Board Settings |\n|-----------|------------|-------------|---------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|\n| Member    | ✔️         | ✔️          | ✔️      | ✔️        |                   |                |           |             |             |               |\n| Moderator | ✔️         | ✔️          | ✔️      | ✔️        | ✔️                | ✔️             | ✔️        |             |             |               |\n| Admin     | ✔️         | ✔️          | ✔️      | ✔️        | ✔️                | ✔️             | ✔️        | ✔️          | ✔️          | ✔️             |\n\n- ✔️ = Permission granted\n- Empty = Permission denied\n\n**Practical Example:** When a moderator attempts to remove a reported post, the system validates their role. If assigned as 'moderator' (or higher), the deletion is processed; otherwise, access is denied with an appropriate notification.\n\n## 3. Permission Principles & Escalation\n\n- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Each user only has the minimum permission necessary for their role.\n- **Role Escalation:** Elevation requires admin action and explicit confirmation; no self-escalations.\n- **Temporary Permissions:** E.g., a member assigned as a \"guest moderator\" for a week returns to member status after the period.\n- **Audit Trail:** All escalation and sensitive actions trigger audit log entries for compliance and review.\n\n**Example:** Moderator Sarah’s temporary permissions expire, and her ability to ban users is automatically revoked.\n\n## 4. Access Control Implementation Guidance\n\n- **Authentication:** Use secure session-based tokens or OAuth2 mechanisms to verify identity prior to enforcing permissions.\n- **Role Checks:** Every sensitive action (e.g., edit/delete post) requires a permission check based on the user’s current role, enforced at both API and UI layers.\n- **Permission Denied:** All denied actions should return clear error messages for transparency (e.g., \"You do not have permission to delete this post.\").\n- **Role Assignment:** Ensure admins use a dedicated interface for granting/revoking roles to prevent privilege escalation or assignment errors.\n- **Logging:** All role assignment, deletion, and escalation events must be logged with timestamps and administrator identification for auditing purposes.\n\n**Best Practice Example:**\n- The API checks `user.role` before every board-altering request. A request to ban a user from a member results in a 403 Forbidden, while a moderator’s request is accepted and logged.\n\n## 5. Example Flows\n\n### Posting a Topic (Member)\n- Authenticate as member → Navigate to board → Click 'New Topic' → Fill content → Submit → Topic appears instantly.\n\n### Deleting a Post (Moderator)\n- Authenticate as moderator → Locate reported post → Use 'Delete' option → System checks role → Post is removed, action is logged.\n\n### Assigning Moderator Role (Admin)\n- Admin accesses user management panel → Selects user → Assigns 'moderator' role → Confirmation required → Change is saved and logged.\n\n## 6. Back to Table of Contents\n\nThe Table of Contents for the Discussion Board system provides an organized overview of all planning and implementation documents, such as business requirements, user journeys, roles and permissions, business rules, and workflows. It serves as the primary roadmap, allowing stakeholders and developers to quickly navigate to sections relevant to their needs within the project.","04_business_rules_and_workflows_discussionboard.md":"# Business Rules and Workflows – Discussion Board\n\n## 1. Overview\nThis document outlines the business rules and workflows that govern how the discussion board operates. It ensures clear, consistent application of rules for posting, moderating, reporting, and platform management, supporting fair participation and robust content quality.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Posting & Interaction Rules\n- **Eligibility**: Only logged-in users with the `member` role or higher may create new topics, posts, or comments.\n- **Content Guidelines**: All content must adhere to the platform’s code of conduct (e.g., no hate speech, spam, or personal attacks).\n- **Editing & Deleting**: Users may edit or delete their own posts/comments unless locked by a moderator.\n- **Engagement Features**: Users can like/upvote or downvote posts and comments. Abuse of voting, such as vote manipulation, may result in restrictions.\n- **Rate Limiting**: The platform enforces posting and commenting frequency limits to reduce spam (e.g., max 5 posts/hour).\n\n## 3. Moderation & Escalation Workflows\n- **Moderation Actions**: Moderators and admins can:\n  - Edit or delete any user’s content if it violates rules\n  - Lock, pin or unpin posts for visibility or investigation\n  - Suspend member accounts temporarily for infractions\n- **Reporting Process**:\n  1. Any member can report content or users for violations\n  2. Reported items are added to a review queue for moderators\n  3. Moderators must review and take action on reports within a defined SLA (e.g., 24 hours)\n  4. Action outcomes notify reporting user and accused party via platform notification\n\n## 4. Role-Based Permissions & Escalation\n- **Member**: \n  - Cannot moderate, but can report issues\n  - Receives warnings for policy violations; repeated offenses escalate penalties automatically (e.g., 3 warnings = temp ban)\n- **Moderator**:\n  - Acts as first-line review for all reports\n  - Can escalate sensitive or ambiguous cases to admins\n  - Required to document rationale for all punitive actions\n- **Admin**:\n  - Reviews and configures business workflow rules and system settings\n  - Final authority on disputed or complex cases\n  - Responsible for platform-wide announcements and policy updates\n\n## 5.
