The discussion board is designed as a dynamic online platform intended to facilitate high-quality, respectful, and open exchanges on political and economic topics. By offering an organized space for diverse dialogue, the platform aims to inform, educate, and empower users ranging from casual readers to expert contributors.\n\n## Purpose and Vision\nThe primary purpose of the discussion board is to foster thoughtful, fact-based debate and knowledge-sharing within communities interested in governance, economics, policymaking, and related domains. The vision is to create a trusted forum where individuals can discuss ideas, contest opinions, and broaden their understanding in a non-partisan, well-moderated environment.\n\n## Business Context\nDiscourse about political and economic issues often suffers from fragmentation, lack of moderation, and echo chambers. This project addresses these challenges by introducing a community-run board with clear responsibilities, structured topics, and mechanisms for feedback. The platform’s design supports scalability for growing user bases and topical expansions.\n\n## User Personas\n- **Administrators**: Responsible for overall system management, enforcement of platform policies, and configuration of discussion topics.\n- **Moderators**: Charged with maintaining order, mediating disputes, reviewing user-generated content, and upholding community guidelines.\n- **Members**: Authenticated users who create content, join discussions, voice opinions, and contribute to the board’s vibrancy.\n- **Guests**: Non-registered visitors who can view but not participate, serving as potential new members.\n\n## Key Objectives\n- THE platform SHALL enable structured, transparent, and civil conversations around political and economic issues.\n- THE system SHALL ensure a safe space for discourse through effective moderation and clear role definition.\n- THE service SHALL provide seamless onboarding for new members while protecting community standards.\n- THE discussion board SHALL be scalable and maintainable as user numbers and topics increase.\n\n## Target Outcomes\n- Increase user engagement and high-quality participation within three months of launch.\n- Achieve high user retention by cultivating a respectful and inclusive atmosphere.\n- Provide actionable insights through activity analytics and user feedback loops for continuous improvement.\n\n## Governance and Ethics\nThe platform is committed to upholding democratic values, transparency, and user privacy. Community guidelines are enforced to discourage misinformation and abusive behavior. Regular audits and feedback cycles ensure accountability and ongoing alignment with platform values.\n\n## Constraints and Assumptions\n- Content moderation tools are critical for success and must be accessible to authorized roles at all times.\n- The user interface SHALL prioritize usability for non-technical audiences.\n- Privacy policies and local regulations concerning data protection SHALL always be observed.\n- Multilingual support is a future consideration to broaden the user base.\n\n## Revision History\n- Initial version created on 2025-07-29 by the Planning Expert.\n","02_discussion_board_roles_and_permissions.md":"# Discussion Board Roles and Permissions\n\n## 1. Overview\nThis document defines the permissions structure and authentication rules for the Discussion Board module. It outlines all available roles—admin, moderator, member, guest—along with their capabilities, the governing authentication and authorization policies, and guidance for extensibility and integration.\n\n## 2. Role Definitions\n\n- **Admin**: Full platform control, including user, content, settings, reports, and analytics management.\n- **Moderator**: Can review, edit, approve, delete, or hide posts/comments, handle user reports, enforce guidelines, and escalate issues to admin.\n- **Member**: Authenticated users able to create/reply to topics, edit/delete own posts, and report content.\n- **Guest**: Unauthenticated users permitted only to browse public content; cannot interact (like, comment, report) or access restricted forums/topics.\n\n## 3.

Role-Based Requirements (EARS)\nTHE system SHALL restrict topic creation to authenticated users with at least member privileges.\n\nWHEN a moderator or admin detects inappropriate content, THE system SHALL enable post hiding, editing, or deletion.\n\nIF a guest attempts to interact beyond browsing, THEN THE system SHALL redirect to login or show an access denied message.\n\nWHEN a user reports content, THE system SHALL notify moderators and log the report for further review.\n\n## 5. Authentication Policies (EARS-Compliant and Expanded)\nWHEN accessing protected actions (post, edit, reply, report, moderate), THE system SHALL verify that the user’s session token is valid and maps to an active role with the required permissions.\n\nWHERE multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for admins, THE system SHALL prompt for an additional factor upon login for all admin users.\n\nWHILE the user session is active, THE system SHALL associate every action with the user’s role and ID for traceability.\n\nIF a user’s account is suspended or deactivated, THEN THE system SHALL immediately revoke access to all protected actions, including ongoing sessions.\n\n**Practical Use Cases & Edge Cases:**\n- For forums integrated with Single Sign-On (SSO), THE system SHALL respect external identity providers' role assertions to map users seamlessly into board roles, preventing privilege escalation during the mapping process.\n- WHEN an expired authentication token is detected during an API request (e.g., posting a comment), THE system SHALL respond with a clear error, prompting the user to re-authenticate, ensuring that failed or unsafe transactions do not alter the board state.\n\n## 6. Notes on Extensibility (EARS-Compliant and Expanded)\nWHEN a new role (e.g., \"Trusted Contributor\") is needed, THE system SHALL allow role definitions, including unique permissions, to be added via admin UI or configuration, ensuring future feature growth does not require codebase changes for basic permission assignment.\n\nWHERE integration with external moderation tools (e.g., automated toxicity detection) is configured, THE system SHALL treat external moderation outcomes as input events and apply mapped actions (hide, escalate, notify) according to admin-defined policy.\n\n**Examples & Integration Scenarios:**\n- WHEN integrating with an external project management tool (like Jira), THE system SHALL provide an API for admins to sync roles, such that task assignments on Jira can influence a user’s board permissions temporarily.\n- When GDPR compliance is required, THE system SHALL allow role-based access to personal data, ensuring only admins can execute user data export or anonymization.\n\n## 7. Acceptance Criteria (EARS-Compliant and Expanded)\nWHEN configuring permissions via admin dashboard, THE system SHALL save changes instantly and apply them across all active sessions, guaranteeing that new permission rules take effect immediately.\n\nIF a member tries to edit another user’s post, THEN THE system SHALL block the action and provide a standard error message explaining insufficient permissions.\n\nWHEN a guest attempts to report content, THE system SHALL deny the request and prompt for registration or login, ensuring reporting is only available to authenticated users.\n\n**Practical Acceptance Scenarios:**\n- For edge cases like revoked moderator privileges, THE system SHALL ensure that active web sockets and background moderation tasks are disconnected or reassigned without data loss.\n- WHEN roles or permissions are modified in an integrated HR system, THE system SHALL reconcile changes on the board within five minutes, guaranteeing role synchronization throughout the platform.\n\n---\n- [Back to Table of Contents](./00_discussion_board_toc.md)","03_discussion_board_user_journey_and_use_cases.md":"# Discussion Board – User Journeys and Use Cases\n\n## Overview\nThis document details the core user journeys and functional use cases for the Discussion Board system.

Detailed Use Case Narratives\n### Browse Topics (Guest/Member)\n- Positive Flow: User lands on the board, sees organized categories and threads, and clicks into a topic where posts appear in order. Paging and sorting apply based on preferences.\n- Negative Flow: Network failure prompts error page with retry; unauthorized access (private topic) returns access denied.\n\n### Register & Login (Guest)\n- Positive Flow: Guest enters valid details, passes CAPTCHA, verifies email, and is logged in. Session created, redirected to main feed.\n- Negative Flow: Already-used email triggers error and disables further input until resolved.\n\n### Post Thread/Comment (Member)\n- Positive Flow: Member enters content, preview renders, and submit posts immediately.\n- Negative Flow: Posting blank message triggers validation error; session expiration requires re-login; repeated failed attempts lock posting.\n\n### Edit/Delete Own Post (Member)\n- Positive Flow: Member edits post in place; changes saved, post version updated.\n- Negative Flow: Unauthorized edits (e.g., to others’ posts) are denied, and an error is shown.\n\n### Report Content (Member)\n- Positive Flow: Member reports an abusive comment, which is instantly queued for moderation with reference and evidence.\n- Negative Flow: Duplicate reports from same user are blocked with a notice.\n\n### Moderate Content (Moderator)\n- Positive Flow: Moderator sees all pending reports, reviews evidence, issues a warning, and deletes infringing post.\n- Negative Flow: Attempted action on resolved report is denied; audit log notes action.\n\n### Manage Users/Roles (Admin)\n- Positive Flow: Admin assigns a moderator, logs the change.\n- Negative Flow: Admin attempts to ban non-existent user; action is blocked with notification.\n\n### Manage Categories (Admin)\n- Positive Flow: Admin adds new topic, which appears for all users instantly.\n- Negative Flow: Removing an in-use category prompts dependencies warning.\n\n### View Analytics (Admin)\n- Positive Flow: Admin accesses stats dashboard.\n- Negative Flow: Data query fails; admin is shown troubleshooting steps.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Acceptance Criteria\n- THE system SHALL ensure guests cannot interact beyond browsing public content.\n- WHEN a user attempts prohibited actions, THE system SHALL provide clear feedback.\n- WHEN a member posts, THE system SHALL confirm success or display errors, specifying the cause.\n- IF duplicate content is submitted, THEN THE system SHALL block submission and indicate duplication.\n- WHEN moderation occurs, THE system SHALL log all actions with timestamps and actor information.\n- IF network/service outages prevent actions, THEN THE system SHALL display status and recovery options.\n- WHEN admins alter roles/categorization, THE system SHALL update relevant privileges and display results.\n- IF inappropriate escalation occurs (e.g., a moderator tries admin-only actions), THEN THE system SHALL block and log attempt.\n- WHEN analytics are requested, THE system SHALL render up-to-date insights or feedback on data issues.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Example System Flows (Mermaid Diagrams)\n\n### Member Fails Content Submission\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Member\n    participant S as System\n    M->>S: Submit new comment (empty content)\n    S-->>M: Display validation error (must add content)\n    M->>S: Retry submission (invalid format)\n    S-->>M: Display specific format error\n    M->>S: Submit valid comment\n    S-->>M: Confirm and post comment\n```\n\n### Admin Manages Categories\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Admin\n    participant S as System\n    A->>S: Create new category\n    S-->>A: Validate (no duplicate)\n    S-->>A: Confirm creation\n    A->>S: Delete existing category (in use)\n    S-->>A: Warn about dependencies, prevent deletion\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Roles & Permissions\nFour primary roles govern the discussion board:\n- **Admin:** Full access, can manage users, roles, categories, and view analytics. They may assign or revoke moderator privileges, configure all board settings, and intervene at any operational level.\n- **Moderator:** Trusted members with powers to review, edit, remove content, resolve user reports, manage user warnings/bans (within limits), and help maintain community order.\n- **Member:** Registered users who can create threads, comment, edit or delete their own posts, report content, and engage with others.\n- **Guest:** Unauthenticated users limited to browsing public content, unable to interact without registration.\nPermissions matrix governs feature access for each role, ensuring system integrity and proper escalation paths.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Features & Workflow\nThe discussion board boasts:\n- **Topic & Category Management:** Hierarchical organization, with admins empowered for structural changes.\n- **Posting & Commenting:** Feature-rich editor, real-time preview, markdown/code formatting, edit history.\n- **Moderation Tools:** Flagged-content queues, batch actions, moderation logs, evidence attachment for reports.\n- **User & Role Management:** Admins can promote/demote moderators, ban/unban users, and audit actions.\n- **Analytics & Reporting:** Insights for engagement, trending topics, moderation efficiency, and retention.\n- **Security & Error Handling:** Role-based access, input validation, detailed error messages, audit trails for sensitive actions.\nWorkflow connects these features via logical progressions: guests become members, members contribute and report, moderators curate, and admins oversee and refine system operations.","04_discussion_board_features_and_workflow.md":"# Discussion Board Features and Workflow\n\n## Overview\nThis document defines the core features and workflows of the discussion board system.
