      "03_discussionboard_user_roles_and_permissions.md": "# User Roles & Permissions for the Discussion Board\n\n## Overview\nProper role-based access control is essential for the operation, management, and security of the discussion board. This document outlines all user roles, their permissions, and summarizes core mechanisms for authentication and authorization. This model supports maintainability, secure access, and future feature growth.\n\n## Defined User Roles\n\n| Role       | Description                                                                                                       |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Member     | Regular registered user who can participate in discussions, create and interact with posts, and use reporting features. |\n| Moderator  | Trusted user responsible for content oversight, enforcing guidelines, and handling reported items.               |\n| Admin      | System administrator with comprehensive platform control, including user, moderator, and settings management.     |\n\n## Permissions Matrix\n\n| Permission                              | Member | Moderator | Admin |\n|------------------------------------------|:------:|:---------:|:-----:|\n| Register / Login                        |   ✓    |     ✓     |   ✓   |\n| Create, Edit, Delete Own Posts          |   ✓    |     ✓     |   ✓   |\n| Comment / Like                          |   ✓    |     ✓     |   ✓   |\n| Report Inappropriate Content            |   ✓    |     ✓     |   ✓   |\n| Moderate (Edit/Delete Others’ Content)  |        |     ✓     |   ✓   |\n| Manage Reports/Resolve Issues           |        |     ✓     |   ✓   |\n| Manage Members (ban, role change)       |        |           |   ✓   |\n| Manage Moderators                       |        |           |   ✓   |\n| Access Admin Dashboard/Settings         |        |           |   ✓   |\n| Platform Configuration                  |        |           |   ✓   |\n\n## Role Change & Escalation\n- **Promotion to Moderator**: Only Admin can assign Moderator roles.\n- **Demotion/Promotion**: Admin can manage all role assignments. Members and Moderators cannot self-promote.\n- **Ban/Deactivate**: Admin can suspend or ban any user; Moderators may suggest bans (for Admin review).\n\n## Authentication & Authorization Model\n- **Authentication**: All users (member, moderator, admin) authenticate via secure login (email/password or SSO).\n- **Session Management**: Tokens/session cookies to represent active logins; refresh as required.\n- **Authorization**: Role is bundled with user profile; each API checks role-linked permissions prior to fulfilling requests.\n- **API Enforcement**: Endpoints are protected so only users with sufficient permissions can execute sensitive actions (e.g., moderation, admin commands).\n\n## User Management Flows\n- **User Registration & Login**: Members self-register; moderators/admins are promoted by Admin.\n- **Role Assignment/Revoke**: Only Admin has API/UI controls to configure roles for any user.\n- **Audit Logging**: Sensitive actions, especially bans or role changes, are logged for traceability.\n\n## Security & Best Practices\n- All privileged actions (moderator/admin) require authentication and strong authorization checks.\n- Minimize privilege escalation risk by preventing self-assignment of higher roles.\n- Regularly audit user role changes; provide notification of changes to affected users.\n\n## Appendix\n- For business rules and API endpoint protection: see [02_discussionboard_functional_requirements.md].\n- For the platform’s overall scope: see [01_discussionboard_overview_and_scope.md].\n"
