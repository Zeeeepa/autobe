It combines open participation with verifiable expertise, structured fact-checking, and transparent, policy-led moderation. Members of the public can raise civic questions and debate policy topics; identity- or expertise-verified contributors add qualified analysis; fact checkers annotate claims with sources; moderators enforce policy with documented rationales; and administrators govern platform-wide policies and safeguards.\n\nThe platform addresses three persistent gaps in online civic discussion: (1) low signal-to-noise that impedes constructive debate, (2) weak pathways for in-thread evidence and expertise, and (3) opaque or inconsistent moderation that undermines trust. By introducing role-based trust layers, claim-level fact-check annotations, explicit enforcement rationales, and measurable service-level expectations, civicDebateBoard aims to become a trusted venue for citizens, journalists, researchers, and policymakers to engage responsibly and learn from each other.\n\nContext and complementary materials are available in the [Market Problem and Value Proposition](./02-market-problem-and-value-proposition.md), the [Functional Requirements Specification](./06-functional-requirements.md), and the [Business Model and Analytics Strategy](./10-business-model-and-analytics.md). A navigable index is provided in the [Documentation Index and Reading Guide](./00-toc.md).\n\n## Objectives and Success Criteria\nStrategic objectives translate into measurable outcomes. Requirements below are expressed with EARS syntax where applicable for clarity and testability.\n\n### Strategic Objectives\n- Establish a trusted environment for evidence-centered civic debate that welcomes diverse participation while elevating verifiable information.\n- Provide clear, consistent, and transparent moderation and fact-check processes, including rationales and appeal mechanisms.\n- Achieve sustainable operations through ethical monetization aligned with civic mission and safety guardrails.\n\n### Key Results and Targets (12–18 months)\n- Community Health and Quality\n  - At least 70% of active discussions contain a sourced claim or a fact-check annotation within 24 hours of first reply.\n  - Median moderation first-action times: ≤ 30 minutes for P1 (safety) during active hours; ≤ 4 hours for standard P2/P3.\n  - Correction adoption rate ≥ 60% for content found materially inaccurate by accepted fact checks.\n- Engagement and Reach\n  - Monthly Active Users (MAU) ≥ 100,000; 90-day retention for new members ≥ 35%.\n  - Verified expert participation in ≥ 20% of high-visibility threads (top decile by engagement).\n  - Average time-to-first-meaningful-response on public-interest threads ≤ 10 minutes during peak hours.\n- Trust and Transparency\n  - ≥ 95% of enforcement actions provide machine-readable and human-readable rationales visible to impacted users.\n  - ≥ 95% of appeals include written outcomes with policy references and are delivered within published SLAs.\n\n### EARS-Formatted Success Requirements\n- THE platform SHALL support roles \"member\", \"verifiedMember\", \"factChecker\", \"moderator\", and \"admin\" as the basis for participation and accountability.\n- WHEN a user submits a P1 (safety) report, THE platform SHALL place the item in the moderation queue within 1 minute and SHALL present a receipt with a reference ID to the reporter.\n- WHEN a fact-check annotation with at least one citation is submitted by a factChecker, THE platform SHALL attach it to the referenced claim and SHALL present the annotation status as \"proposed\", \"accepted\", or \"contested\" to readers.\n- IF content is sanctioned with a warning, mute, or suspension, THEN THE platform SHALL notify the content owner with the policy basis, duration, and appeal options within 1 minute of action.\n- WHERE a thread is labeled as public-interest or time-sensitive (e.g., election-related), THE platform SHALL elevate review priority and SHALL target first-action within 15 minutes during active periods.\n- THE platform SHALL present timestamps, quotas, and durations in the user’s locale and timezone for clarity of notices and sanctions.\n\n## Target Users and Use Cases\nRoles define how users participate and are held accountable in business terms.\n\n- Member (member)\n  - Authenticated participant who can create and manage own posts and comments; react and vote; follow topics; bookmark; report content; and manage account settings under rate limits and policies.\n  - Primary outcomes: raise civic questions; contribute experiences; signal interest via voting; report misconduct with reasoned categories.\n\n- Verified Member (verifiedMember)\n  - Identity- or expertise-verified participant with elevated trust and accountability; can create expert-tagged posts and host structured Q&A sessions.\n  - Primary outcomes: provide qualified analysis; clarify complex topics; cite credible sources; lead high-signal events such as AMAs.\n\n- Fact Checker (factChecker)\n  - Trusted role focused on integrity; can add claim-level annotations with sources, propose corrective labels, and collaborate with moderators; cannot sanction directly.\n  - Primary outcomes: annotate claims; surface evidence; propose corrections; increase information quality.\n\n- Moderator (moderator)\n  - Responsible for triaging reports, reviewing content, applying policy decisions, issuing warnings and sanctions, handling appeals at first level, and maintaining audit trails.\n  - Primary outcomes: enforce policy consistently; meet review SLAs; communicate decisions with policy references.\n\n- Administrator (admin)\n  - Governs policies, categories, tags, role assignments, sanctions configuration, and compliance reviews; performs all moderator actions plus administrative operations.\n  - Primary outcomes: maintain governance; calibrate policies; ensure compliance; approve sensitive operations (e.g., data exports) in line with policy.\n\n### Representative Use Cases\n- Public-interest debate: A member starts a thread on election policy; verifiedMembers provide expert context; factCheckers annotate claims; moderators enforce civility and rules with transparent outcomes.\n- Fast misinformation response: A viral claim is reported; factCheckers propose annotations; moderators apply interim labels and review within accelerated SLAs.\n- Expert Q&A (AMA): A verifiedMember hosts a scheduled session; members submit questions; evidence-backed answers are curated; summaries remain accessible for public reference.\n- Policy transparency in enforcement: A sanctioned user receives a rationale with policy references and appeal windows; rationales are visible to the impacted user and auditable by authorized roles.\n\n## Service Scope and Boundaries\n\n### In Scope (Business Capabilities)\n- Role-based participation aligned to the roles above with calibrated privileges and accountability.\n- Threaded discussions (posts, comments, replies) with reactions and voting; organization by tags, topics, and categories.\n- Reporting and moderation workflows with prioritization, interim actions, rationales, and appeal mechanisms.\n- Fact-check lifecycle: submission, review, acceptance/rejection, and visible annotations on referenced claims.\n- Transparency and audit: policy references with sanctions, appeals outcomes, and role-appropriate audit views.\n- Notifications for replies, mentions, moderation decisions, and fact-check updates, respecting user preferences.\n- Ethical growth and monetization features (e.g., sponsorships, subscriptions) governed by guardrails that protect civic integrity.\n\n### Boundaries and Operating Principles\n- Civic mission first: quality and safety precede raw engagement or virality.\n- Evidence-centered dialogue: claims encouraged to reference credible sources; expert contributions are labeled.\n- Transparent enforcement: actions include rationale, duration, and appeal paths; outcomes follow documented SLAs.\n- Inclusivity and accessibility: participation is encouraged across backgrounds, languages, and abilities, within community norms and policies.\n\n### High-Level Interaction Flow\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Public Participation\"\n    U[\"Members & Verified Members\"] --> P[\"Posts & Comments\"]\n    P --> R[\"Report Content Action\"]\n    P --> N[\"Notifications to Followers\"]\n    P --> T[\"Topic & Category Organization\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Quality & Integrity\"\n    V[\"Fact Checkers\"] --> F[\"Fact-Check Annotations\"]\n    F --> P\n    R --> M[\"Moderation Review Queue\"]\n    M --> E[\"Enforcement & Appeals\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Governance\"\n    A[\"Administrators\"] --> S[\"Policies, Roles, Settings\"]\n    S -.-> M\n    S -.-> T\n  end\n```\n\n## Business Model (Why, Revenue Strategy, Growth Plan, Success Metrics)\n\n### Why This Service Exists\n- Problem: Civic discussion spaces often degrade into low-signal debate, misinformation, and harassment, discouraging participation and expert input.\n- Opportunity: Combining open dialogue with verifiable expertise and structured fact-checking can materially improve discourse quality and civic literacy.\n- Differentiation: Role-based trust layers (verified experts and fact checkers), transparent enforcement with measurable SLAs, and annotation-first handling of claims distinguish civicDebateBoard from generic forums and social feeds.\n\n### Revenue Strategy (How)\n- Primary: Ethical sponsorships of civic topics with strict conflict-of-interest guardrails and clear disclosure labels.\n- Secondary: Organizational subscriptions for curated debates, AMAs, and research initiatives with enhanced moderation support.\n- Tertiary: Community memberships providing perks (topic curation, early access, recognition badges) without pay-to-speak or pay-to-amplify mechanics.\n- Guardrails: No targeted political ads; no pay-for-reach; mandatory sponsorship disclosures; strong separation between editorial independence and sponsorship.\n\n### What This Service Delivers (Business Operations)\n- Evidence-centered civic debate with role accountability and annotated claims.\n- Structured policy and enforcement workflows that provide consistent, explainable outcomes with auditable rationales.\n- Transparent public-interest programming (e.g., expert Q&A series) that remains accessible as a knowledge resource.\n- Ethical monetization that supports the mission without compromising discourse integrity or safety.\n\n### Growth Plan\n- Acquisition: Partnerships with universities, think tanks, public libraries, NGOs, journalist networks, and local governments; organic growth from high-quality public-interest threads and expert programming.\n- Activation and Retention: Onboarding that encourages citation-backed contributions; scheduled expert sessions; recognition programs for constructive participation and verified expertise.\n- Network Effects: Topic following and notifications; recurring event series; durable knowledge artifacts (accepted fact checks, AMA summaries) that drive inbound interest.\n\n### Success Metrics and KPIs\n- Reach and Engagement: MAU/DAU, session frequency, and time-to-first-meaningful-response on public-interest threads.\n- Quality and Integrity: Share of posts with citations; fact-check turnaround; accepted vs. contested annotations; rate of corrected or retracted claims.\n- Safety and Trust: SLA adherence in moderation and appeals; user satisfaction with enforcement communications; reduction in repeat violations.\n- Sustainability: Sponsorship revenue by topic (with disclosures), institutional subscription retention, membership conversion and churn.\n\n## Assumptions and Constraints\n\n### Assumptions\n- Roles and Identity: Users authenticate and can be associated with one or more of the defined roles with auditable transitions (e.g., member → verifiedMember).\n- Policy Governance: Content rules, sanctions, priorities, and appeals are governed by documented policies that can be updated with oversight.\n- Time Sensitivity: Certain threads (e.g., election or emergency-related) require elevated review priority and faster turnaround than standard discussions.\n- International Participation: Users participate across time zones; timestamps and notices align to user locale for clarity.\n\n### Constraints\n- Safety Over Virality: Business processes privilege community safety and integrity over growth tactics that increase harm risk.\n- Transparency Obligation: Enforcement communications must include rationales with policy references; appeals must produce documented outcomes.\n- Ethical Monetization: Revenue activities cannot bias discourse or undermine safety and independence.\n- Privacy and Compliance: Data rights and legal obligations are honored per applicable jurisdictions; security expectations are treated as business obligations.\n\n### EARS-Formatted Operating Constraints\n- THE service SHALL include policy references and human-readable rationales with all sanctions visible to the impacted user.\n- WHERE sponsorship is present, THE service SHALL label sponsored sessions and SHALL disclose sponsor identity to participants in all related surfaces.\n- IF an expert-tagged post by a verifiedMember is found materially inaccurate, THEN THE service SHALL require correction or visible annotation prior to further amplification.\n- WHILE a discussion is under active appeal, THE service SHALL preserve evidence and SHALL restrict irreversible enforcement until appeal resolution except where safety risk requires immediate action.\n- THE service SHALL reserve high-priority triage for public-interest and time-sensitive topics during defined civic windows (e.g., election periods) with accelerated response targets.\n- WHEN notifications are generated for policy decisions or annotations, THE service SHALL deliver them within the published timeframe and SHALL honor user preferences except where notices are mandatory.\n\n## Out of Scope\nTo keep the vision coherent and delivery focused, the following are out of scope in the current planning horizon:\n- Frontend UI/UX specifications, visual design systems, and screen layouts.\n- Technical implementation details such as APIs, database schemas, infrastructure choices, or deployment topologies.\n- Paid amplification mechanisms (pay-for-reach, targeted political ads) or monetization that could bias civic discourse.\n- Real-time voice or video townhalls; the focus is asynchronous and near-synchronous text with notifications.\n- Third-party data brokerage or resale of user data.\n\n---\n\nAll content in this overview expresses business requirements and expectations only;

Mainstream social feeds optimize for virality and novelty, not deliberative quality. Generic forums depend on inconsistent volunteer moderation without evidence workflows. Stakeholders lack shared accountability mechanisms that elevate expertise and protect participants.\n\nRole-based pains observed across civic communities:\n\n- Members (general participants)\n  - Encounter hostility, brigading, and low-trust environments that deter participation and reduce willingness to share nuanced perspectives.\n  - Lack reliable tools to follow civic topics, bookmark complex threads, and surface credible sources amid noise.\n  - Experience inconsistent enforcement, leading to perceptions of unfairness and disengagement.\n\n- Verified Members (identity- or expertise-verified participants)\n  - Struggle to make qualified contributions visible without being drowned out by engagement-biased ranking or low-quality replies.\n  - Face higher scrutiny with limited affordances to demonstrate expertise (e.g., expert tags with context and accountability).\n\n- Fact Checkers (trusted integrity role)\n  - Lack in-platform tools to attach claim-level annotations with citations and transparent ratings (e.g., true, needs context, misleading, false).\n  - Experience friction collaborating with moderators; proposed corrections are slow to propagate or hard to discover.\n\n- Moderators (community safety role)\n  - Overwhelmed by report volumes without standardized evidence intake, triage SLAs, or audit trails for consistent decisions and appeals.\n  - Encounter accusations of bias without transparent policy scaffolding or publishable enforcement metrics.\n\n- Admins (governance role)\n  - Need configurable policies, categories, and sanctions with clear oversight for compliance and election-related protections.\n  - Require partner-ready governance artifacts and transparency logs to maintain institutional trust.\n\nUnderlying structural causes:\n- Engagement-first incentives that amplify outrage and novelty rather than verifiable substance.\n- Insufficient role differentiation that fails to elevate credible expertise or structure integrity work.\n- Missing claim-level evidence mechanisms making corrections adversarial and hard to track.\n- Opaque moderation without consistent rationales, timelines, or appeal visibility.\n\ncivicDebateBoard addresses these pains by centering deliberation quality, role-based accountability, and transparent governance so that open participation can coexist with trust, safety, and evidence.\n\n## Market Context and Trends\nPersistent and accelerating trends intensify demand for a purpose-built civic debate platform:\n\n- Trust & Safety Maturation: Movement from reactive takedowns to policy-led enforcement with auditable rationale, SLAs, and appeal processes demanded by regulators and civil society.\n- Election Integrity Focus: Recurring election cycles elevate risks of misinformation, voter suppression narratives, and coordinated manipulation; stakeholders require rapid, auditable responses.\n- Role-Based Communities: Professional networks and QA platforms demonstrate the value of role differentiation (experts, moderators, reviewers) to improve signal quality and accountability.\n- Evidence-Seeking Behavior: Audiences increasingly look for citations and context, favoring spaces that reward substantiated claims over performative engagement.\n- Ethical Monetization: Preference for models that do not rely on polarization or sensitive microtargeting; institutions seek credible venues for public-interest dialogues.\n- Compliance & Platform Accountability: Privacy and platform rules (e.g., GDPR-like regimes and election-related guidelines) drive expectations for auditability, transparency logs, and rights-respecting processes.\n\nOpportunity emerges where open participation meets evidence-backed, role-accountable debate with measurable transparency.\n\n## Competitive Landscape\nAdjacent categories offer partial solutions but do not integrate deliberation depth, trust mechanisms, and scalable safety operations in one cohesive service.\n\n| Category | Strengths | Gaps vs civicDebateBoard | Implication |\n|---------|-----------|--------------------------|-------------|\n| Mainstream Social Networks | Reach, real-time updates | Engagement-first ranking, weak role differentiation, opaque moderation, externalized fact-checks | Poor fit for sustained, evidence-led debate |\n| Traditional Forums/Subforums | Topic organization, community ownership | Inconsistent moderation, minimal evidence workflows, fragmented appeals | Quality variance; low auditability |\n| Q&A/Knowledge Platforms | Reputation systems, focus on accuracy | Not optimized for multi-perspective civic debate or time-bounded events; limited misinformation surge handling | Insufficient for dynamic civic contexts |\n| News Comments & Publisher Communities | Article context | Fragmented across sites, minimal transparency for enforcement, weak cross-thread continuity | Limited network effects for civic discourse |\n| Specialized Fact-Checking Sites | High-quality fact checks | Not interactive platforms; limited integration into ongoing debates; no role-based community | Lacks participatory debate mechanics |\n\nPositioning summary:\n- Competes on deliberation quality, role accountability, and integrated evidence workflows, not on raw audience size or entertainment value.\n- Designed for public-interest partners (NGOs, universities, media, local governments) seeking credible civic dialogues with transparent governance.\n\n## Differentiators and Core Value Proposition\ncivicDebateBoard differentiates through a role-enabled, evidence-forward, transparency-first model tailored to civic conversations.\n\n- Role Differentiation as a First-Class Concept\n  - Members: Clear accountability with rate limits and self-moderation tools to support healthy dialogue.\n  - Verified Members: Expert-tagged content, structured AMAs, calibrated trust signals, and heightened accountability standards.\n  - Fact Checkers: Claim-level annotations with citations, ratings, and transparency notes; collaborative pathways to moderators.\n  - Moderators: Policy-backed triage queues, evidence handling, sanctions catalog, and audit trails for explainable decisions.\n  - Admins: Governance configuration, policy/sanction management, role assignments, and compliance oversight suitable for civic contexts.\n\n- Evidence-Centric Conversation Mechanics\n  - Claim-level annotation lifecycle (proposal, review, accepted/contested), citation surfacing, and contextual transparency to reduce misinformation persistence.\n  - Topic/category structures aligned to public-interest themes for sustained discovery and coherent debate continuity.\n\n- Transparency and Accountability by Design\n  - Visible policy references accompanying enforcement outcomes, auditable appeals, and publishable transparency logs for aggregated moderation metrics.\n  - Clear conflict-of-interest handling for reviewers and fact checkers to reinforce perceived fairness.\n\n- Safety Without Engagement Maximization\n  - Healthy discourse outcomes prioritized over raw engagement: resolved debates, consensus markers, correction adoption.\n  - Configurable rate limits and thresholds designed to reduce harassment and brigading while preserving legitimate participation.\n\n- Institutional Value\n  - Safe, auditable venue for civic partners to host debates, AMAs, and educational series with measurable integrity signals and trust-building transparency.\n\nValue proposition statement:\n- Enable high-trust, evidence-backed civic discussions that are transparent, role-accountable, and operationally sustainable—improving discourse quality and community legitimacy for members, institutions, and the broader public.\n\nMermaid mapping of pains to differentiators:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"User Pains\"\n    P1[\"Low Signal-to-Noise\"]\n    P2[\"Misinformation Persistence\"]\n    P3[\"Hostility & Brigading\"]\n    P4[\"Opaque Moderation\"]\n    P5[\"Expert Voices Drowned Out\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"civicDebateBoard Differentiators\"\n    D1[\"Role Differentiation\"]\n    D2[\"Claim-Level Annotations\"]\n    D3[\"Transparent Enforcement\"]\n    D4[\"Safety & Rate Limits\"]\n    D5[\"Expert Affordances(AMAs,Tags)\"]\n  end\n  P1 --> D1\n  P1 --> D5\n  P2 --> D2\n  P2 --> D3\n  P3 --> D4\n  P4 --> D3\n  P5 --> D1\n  P5 --> D5\n```\n\n## Risks and Mitigations\nThe civic debate domain includes operational, reputational, legal, and growth risks. Mitigations emphasize governance, standard operating procedures, and role clarity.\n\n- Cold Start and Network Effects\n  - Risk: Difficulty seeding quality discussions without initial critical mass.\n  - Mitigations: Partner-led topic launches (universities, NGOs, councils), scheduled expert AMAs, early emphasis on fact-check visibility and topic curation.\n\n- Abuse, Harassment, and Coordinated Manipulation\n  - Risk: Targeted brigading during sensitive events leading to participant attrition.\n  - Mitigations: Configurable rate limits, graduated sanctions, severity-based triage, conflict-of-interest rules, and transparent enforcement communication.\n\n- Misinformation and Defamation\n  - Risk: Legal and reputational exposure from persistent false claims.\n  - Mitigations: Claim-level annotations, corrections workflow, visibility labels, and verifiable sources coupled with auditable review outcomes.\n\n- Perception of Bias\n  - Risk: Allegations that moderation or fact-checking favors particular viewpoints.\n  - Mitigations: Public policy documentation, consistent SLAs, independence in appeals, conflict-of-interest disclosures, and aggregate transparency reporting.\n\n- Compliance Exposure\n  - Risk: Failure to meet privacy, election-related, or platform accountability obligations.\n  - Mitigations: Governance reviews, consent/rights management, auditability, incident response readiness, and policy updates aligned to civic timelines.\n\n- Monetization Misalignment\n  - Risk: Revenue mechanisms incentivizing polarizing content or undermining trust.\n  - Mitigations: Ethics-aligned sponsorships/subscriptions, bans on sensitive microtargeting, and guardrails tying revenue to quality outcomes.\n\n- Resource Constraints for Moderation and Fact-Checking\n  - Risk: Queues outpace reviewer capacity during peak civic events.\n  - Mitigations: Priority-tier routing, partner escalations for P0/P1 civic topics, scheduled volunteer fact-checker rotations, and temporary amplification dampening until review.\n\n- Community Capture by Factions\n  - Risk: Dominant groups discourage diverse participation and suppress minority voices.\n  - Mitigations: Topic diversity goals, proactive outreach to underrepresented experts, fair-use rate limits, and anti-manipulation rules.\n\nEARS-formatted governance guardrails:\n- THE governance model SHALL require conflict-of-interest disclosures for moderators and factCheckers on assigned cases.\n- WHEN a civic event enters a designated election window, THE enforcement process SHALL apply elevated SLAs and SHALL prioritize election-integrity categories over standard items.\n- IF monetization experiments degrade civic quality metrics beyond thresholds, THEN THE business operations SHALL pause or terminate the experiment and document remediation steps.\n- WHERE partner-hosted dialogues occur, THE community operations team SHALL display sponsorship labels and SHALL preserve editorial independence.\n- WHILE appeal review is pending, THE enforcement process SHALL preserve evidence and SHALL avoid irreversible actions unless safety requires immediate measures.\n\n## Success Metrics Alignment\nSuccess is defined by outcomes that reflect high-quality, trusted civic discourse and durable institutional credibility. Metrics emphasize quality, trust, safety, and mission-aligned growth rather than raw engagement volume.\n\nQuality of Discourse\n- Percentage of posts/comments in designated civic topics that include at least one cited source for material claims.\n- Ratio of resolved threads (consensus markers, accepted corrections) to total active debates.\n\nTrust and Accountability\n- Time to first fact-check annotation on high-velocity claims in priority topics.\n- Appeals resolution time and satisfaction rate measured by post-decision survey where applicable.\n- Transparency log cadence and completeness (share of enforcement actions with visible policy references).\n\nSafety and Moderation Efficiency\n- Triage SLA attainment by severity tier (critical, high, medium, low).\n- Recidivism rate after warnings or sanctions.\n- Share of proactive vs reactive enforcement actions.\n\nCommunity Health and Growth Quality\n- Monthly participation rate of verified members and expert AMA cadence.\n- New member onboarding completion rate with policy acknowledgment.\n- Ratio of constructive participation to removals within sensitive topics during civic events.\n\nPartner and Institutional Adoption\n- Number of hosted civic dialogues by NGOs, universities, or media partners per quarter.\n- Partner retention and satisfaction scores linked to transparency and quality outcomes.\n\nEARS-formatted success commitments (business-level, testable):\n- THE civicDebateBoard SHALL achieve ≥ 90% triage SLA attainment for critical severity reports during designated election windows.\n- THE civicDebateBoard SHALL reach ≥ 80% coverage of flagged high-velocity claims with at least one fact-check annotation within 24 hours.\n- THE civicDebateBoard SHALL keep the recidivism rate for sanctioned users ≤ 10% within 60 days of sanction.\n- THE civicDebateBoard SHALL publish aggregated transparency metrics at least monthly, including counts by category and average time to first action.\n- WHEN an appeal is submitted within the allowed window, THE civicDebateBoard SHALL deliver a decision within 72 hours and SHALL notify the appellant with rationale.\n- WHERE a partner-hosted AMA is sponsored, THE civicDebateBoard SHALL label the session clearly and SHALL retain the label for the archived record.\n\nAlignment and traceability:\n- Strategic framing and business model context are established in the [Service Vision and Overview](./01-service-vision-and-overview.md).\n- Capability-level rules that operationalize these outcomes are specified in the [Functional Requirements Specification](./06-functional-requirements.md).\n\nBusiness requirements only.

Business scope only; all technical implementation decisions (architecture, APIs, database design, cryptography choices, storage mechanisms) belong to the development team. Describes WHAT the system must do in business terms, not HOW to build it.\n\nTerminology\n- “the system”: the civicDebateBoard service\n- “user”: a human end-user operating an account\n- “session”: a login state tied to a device and a token pair\n\nRelated context\n- Functional capabilities: [Functional Requirements Specification](./06-functional-requirements.md)\n- Safety policies: [Content Moderation and Safety Policies](./07-content-moderation-and-safety-policies.md)\n- Security and privacy: [Security, Privacy, and Compliance Requirements](./09-security-privacy-and-compliance.md)\n\n## 1) Definitions and Role Overview\n\n- member: Authenticated community participant who can create and manage own posts and comments, react and vote, follow topics, bookmark, report content, and manage account settings under rate limits and community rules.\n- verifiedMember: Identity- or expertise-verified participant with elevated trust level; may create expert-tagged posts, host AMAs, face higher content accountability, enjoy fewer rate limits, and bypass certain pre-moderation queues while remaining subject to all policies.\n- factChecker: Trusted role allowed to add fact-check annotations, cite sources, flag misleading claims for review, propose corrections, and generate transparency notes; cannot apply sanctions directly.\n- moderator: Role responsible for triaging reports, reviewing content, applying policy decisions, editing/removing violating content, issuing warnings and sanctions, handling appeals within scope, and maintaining community health.\n- admin: Top-level role managing platform-wide policies, categories, tags, feature toggles, role assignments, sanctions configuration, data export approvals, and compliance reviews; can perform all moderator actions plus administrative operations.\n\nEARS global principle\n- THE civicDebateBoard service SHALL protect accounts, content integrity, and community safety through role-based access control, tokenized sessions, and auditable decision-making.\n\n## 2) Authentication Requirements\n\n### 2.1 Registration\n- WHEN a visitor provides required registration attributes (email and password), THE system SHALL create a pending account and send a verification message.\n- THE system SHALL require email uniqueness per account.\n- THE system SHALL enforce password policy at creation (see 2.5 Password Policy and Reset).\n- IF the email is already in use, THEN THE system SHALL reject registration with a clear, non-enumerating message.\n- WHERE legal age or jurisdictional constraints apply, THE system SHALL require age attestation and reject accounts that fail attestation.\n- THE system SHALL limit registration attempts to a maximum of 5 per IP within 1 hour and 2 per email within 24 hours.\n- IF registration throttling thresholds are exceeded, THEN THE system SHALL delay or block further attempts for the applicable cool-down period (minimum 1 hour).\n\n### 2.2 Email Verification\n- WHEN a registration completes, THE system SHALL send a verification link with a validity of 24 hours.\n- WHEN a user requests re-send, THE system SHALL allow up to 3 re-sends within 24 hours.\n- IF the verification link is expired or invalid, THEN THE system SHALL deny verification and provide a re-send path.\n- WHILE the account is unverified, THE system SHALL restrict posting and interaction capabilities to read-only and profile completion functions.\n- WHEN email verification succeeds, THE system SHALL mark the account as verified and lift unverified restrictions.\n\n### 2.3 Login\n- WHEN a user submits email and password, THE system SHALL validate credentials and respond within 2 seconds under normal load.\n- IF the credentials are invalid, THEN THE system SHALL reject login and increment a failed-attempt counter.\n- IF there are 10 failed login attempts for the same account within 15 minutes, THEN THE system SHALL lock login attempts for that account for 15 minutes and notify the user via the primary email.\n- WHERE multi-factor verification is required by policy or risk, THE system SHALL challenge with a secondary factor before establishing a session (see 2.8 Multi-Factor Authentication).\n- WHEN login succeeds, THE system SHALL establish a session associated with a specific device context and issue tokens per Section 4.\n\n### 2.4 Logout\n- WHEN a user invokes logout on a device, THE system SHALL immediately invalidate the corresponding session for that device.\n- WHEN a user invokes “logout from all devices”, THE system SHALL invalidate all sessions and tokens for that user within 60 seconds.\n\n### 2.5 Password Policy and Reset\n- THE system SHALL enforce password complexity at creation and change: minimum 10 characters; must include at least 3 of the following: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, symbols; shall not contain the email local-part; shall not be one of the last 5 used passwords.\n- WHEN a user requests password reset, THE system SHALL send a reset link valid for 60 minutes.\n- IF a reset token is expired, revoked, or invalid, THEN THE system SHALL deny the reset and allow issuing a new token subject to rate limits (max 3 per 24 hours per account).\n- WHEN a password is successfully reset, THE system SHALL revoke all existing sessions and require re-login on all devices.\n- WHEN a user changes password while authenticated, THE system SHALL enforce the same complexity and reuse rules and SHALL revoke all other device sessions within 60 seconds.\n\n### 2.6 Session Management\n- THE system SHALL associate each session with a user, a device context, and a token pair with independent lifetimes (see Section 4).\n- THE system SHALL allow up to 10 concurrent active sessions per user by default.\n- WHERE an organization or policy sets a lower limit, THE system SHALL enforce the configured maximum sessions per user.\n- WHEN a session exceeds its refresh lifetime, THE system SHALL require full login to re-establish a session.\n- WHILE a session is valid, THE system SHALL honor access tokens for authorization checks within their lifetime.\n\n### 2.7 Device Management and Revocation\n- THE system SHALL maintain a list of active sessions and device contexts visible to the account owner (device name, last activity time, approximate location, and creation time) without exposing sensitive identifiers.\n- WHEN the account owner revokes a device session, THE system SHALL invalidate that session’s tokens within 60 seconds and block further refresh for that session.\n- WHEN suspicious activity is detected (e.g., impossible travel, many failed refresh attempts), THE system SHALL flag the session for review and may require re-authentication on next action.\n\n### 2.8 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)\n- WHERE policy, risk scoring, or user preference requires MFA, THE system SHALL require a second factor in addition to password before session establishment.\n- THE system SHALL support recovery options appropriate to policy (e.g., backup codes) without prescribing mechanisms; recovery use SHALL be logged in audit trails.\n- WHERE a device is marked as trusted, THE system SHALL allow skipping MFA for that device for up to 30 days, after which MFA SHALL be required again.\n- IF MFA verification fails 5 times within 15 minutes, THEN THE system SHALL require a cool-down of 15 minutes before another attempt and SHALL notify the account email.\n\n### 2.9 Email Change and Account Recovery\n- WHEN a user requests to change the primary email, THE system SHALL verify current authentication, send confirmation to both old and new emails, and require confirmation within 24 hours to complete the change.\n- IF email change is not confirmed within 24 hours, THEN THE system SHALL cancel the change and retain the old email.\n- WHEN email is changed successfully, THE system SHALL require re-verification of the new email and SHALL revoke all active sessions except the current device session used to complete the change.\n- WHEN an account recovery is initiated due to lost email access, THE system SHALL require additional verification steps defined by policy and SHALL limit account functionality until recovery completes.\n\n### 2.10 Session Idle Timeout and Remember Device\n- WHILE a session is idle, THE system SHALL expire the interactive session after 30 minutes of inactivity and require re-authentication for further actions, without affecting the refresh token lifetime.\n- WHERE a “remember this device” preference is set, THE system SHALL maintain session refresh eligibility for up to 30 days from last credentialed login per Section 4, subject to revocation.\n- IF a high-risk action is initiated (e.g., role change, password change), THEN THE system SHALL require recent re-authentication regardless of idle time or remember-device status.\n\n## 3) Role Hierarchy and Permissions\n\nRole scope and escalation model\n- THE system SHALL implement a hierarchical permission model where admin encompasses moderator permissions; moderator does not encompass admin; factChecker, verifiedMember, and member are orthogonal in scope except where explicitly extended.\n- WHERE a user holds multiple roles, THE system SHALL grant the union of permissions and enforce the strictest accountability and transparency rules that apply to any held role.\n\nRole capabilities (business-level)\n- member\n  - Create, edit, and delete own posts and comments within edit windows and policy.\n  - React, vote, follow topics, bookmark items, and report content.\n  - Manage own account and sessions within limits.\n- verifiedMember\n  - All member capabilities.\n  - Create expert-tagged posts; host AMAs; enjoy reduced pre-moderation and rate limits as defined by policy.\n  - Elevated accountability: content may require more detailed disclosures where applicable.\n- factChecker\n  - Add fact-check annotations tied to specific claims; attach sources and confidence levels.\n  - Flag misleading claims for review; propose corrections; generate transparency notes.\n  - No sanction powers; cannot edit or delete others’ content.\n- moderator\n  - Review reports and queues; apply policy decisions; edit/remove violating content.\n  - Issue warnings, mutes, suspensions within scope; handle appeals at first level.\n  - Access limited audit views necessary for case handling.\n- admin\n  - All moderator capabilities.\n  - Manage platform-wide policies, categories, tags, feature toggles, role assignments, sanctions configuration, data export approvals, and compliance reviews.\n\nEARS role controls\n- WHEN a member attempts to apply a sanction, THE system SHALL deny the action and display insufficient permission.\n- WHEN a factChecker submits a fact-check note, THE system SHALL record it with attribution and route for visibility according to policy.\n- WHEN a moderator removes content, THE system SHALL record the reason, policy reference, and notify the content owner.\n- WHEN an admin changes a user’s role, THE system SHALL record the actor, old role(s), new role(s), timestamp, and justification and SHALL notify the affected user.\n\n## 4) Token Management (JWT) and Session Expiration Policies\n\nBusiness requirements for tokenized sessions\n- THE system SHALL use JWT for access and refresh tokens.\n- THE access token lifetime SHALL be 15 minutes.\n- THE refresh token lifetime SHALL be 14 days, with sliding renewal on successful refresh (rotation) up to a maximum of 30 days from last credentialed login.\n- WHEN a refresh occurs, THE system SHALL rotate the refresh token and invalidate the previous refresh token.\n- IF a previously used refresh token is presented again (reuse), THEN THE system SHALL revoke the corresponding session and require full re-authentication.\n- WHEN a user logs out, THE system SHALL invalidate the associated refresh token(s) and disallow further refresh for that session.\n- THE JWT payload SHALL include at minimum: userId, role, permissions array suitable for authorization checks, issued-at time, expiry time, and a session identifier.\n- WHERE additional security context is configured (e.g., device identifier, risk score), THE system SHALL include business-relevant claims without exposing sensitive personal data.\n- THE system SHALL support immediate revocation within 60 seconds for logout-all and device revocation actions.\n- WHERE clock skew between clients and the system exists, THE system SHALL allow a tolerance of up to 60 seconds for token validation decisions without extending token lifetimes.\n\nBusiness obligations for signing key management (non-technical)\n- THE system SHALL protect token-signing secrets as confidential business assets with access limited to personnel with a defined business need.\n- THE system SHALL rotate token-signing secrets on a regular cadence not to exceed 90 days and upon suspected exposure.\n- WHEN a key rotation occurs, THE system SHALL honor active sessions signed by prior keys for a limited overlap window consistent with security policy while ensuring new tokens use the new key.\n\n## 5) Permission Matrix (Actions vs Roles)\n\nBaseline permissions. Rate limits and policy rules still apply. A check mark means “allowed by default,” a cross means “not allowed”; some actions are “Conditional” as noted.\n\n| Action | member | verifiedMember | factChecker | moderator | admin |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Register account | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Login / Logout | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| View public content | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Create post | ✅ (rate-limited) | ✅

|\n| Access audit logs (case-limited) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (need-to-know) | ✅ (full) |\n| Host AMAs | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ (official) | ✅ |\n\nClarifications\n- “within window” means within the edit/delete grace windows in the [Functional Requirements Specification](./06-functional-requirements.md).\n- “within scope” means within sanction ranges and SLAs in the [Content Moderation and Safety Policies](./07-content-moderation-and-safety-policies.md).\n\n## 6) Authorization Rules and Validation (Business Terms)\n\nGeneral authorization checks\n- WHEN an action requires a specific role, THE system SHALL validate that the role is present in the current session’s permissions.\n- WHEN content ownership is required (e.g., edit own post), THE system SHALL validate the actor is the content owner and the action is within permitted time windows.\n- WHERE actions are rate-limited, THE system SHALL enforce limits per user and per device to prevent abuse.\n\nConflict-of-interest and sensitive actions\n- WHERE an action materially affects another user’s account state (e.g., permanent ban), THE system SHALL require the appropriate role and SHALL capture policy basis and rationale.\n- WHERE sanctions beyond 14 days are considered, THE system SHALL require admin review per safety policy documents.\n\nError-handling\n- IF authorization fails, THEN THE system SHALL deny the action with an explanation appropriate to the user’s role and context without revealing sensitive internal details.\n- IF ownership validation fails, THEN THE system SHALL deny the action and indicate that only the owner may perform it within the permitted window.\n\n## 7) Account Lifecycle\n\nStates (business-level)\n- Registered(Unverified)\n- Email Verified\n- Active\n- Verified Member (overlay role state)\n- Muted (temporary, limited interactions)\n- Suspended (temporary, login allowed only to view notices and appeal)\n- Banned (permanent or long-term; login allowed only for appeals if policy allows)\n- Deleted (pending grace period) / Hard Deleted\n- Appeal Pending (overlay state)\n- Dormant (overlay state for inactivity beyond policy threshold)\n\nTransitions and rules\n- WHEN registration completes, THE system SHALL place the account in Registered(Unverified).\n- WHEN email is verified within 24 hours, THE system SHALL transition to Email Verified.\n- WHEN profile minimums are met (if required), THE system SHALL mark the account Active.\n- WHERE identity or expertise verification is approved by admins, THE system SHALL grant verifiedMember.\n- WHEN a mute sanction is applied, THE system SHALL restrict posting and commenting for the mute duration while allowing read access.\n- WHEN a suspension is applied, THE system SHALL restrict all posting and commenting; login is allowed for reviewing notices and filing appeals.\n- WHEN a ban is applied, THE system SHALL disable access except appeal functions as policy dictates.\n- WHEN a user requests deletion, THE system SHALL place the account in Deleted (pending) with a 30-day grace period for reversal.\n- IF the deletion grace period elapses without reversal, THEN THE system SHALL hard delete the account and irreversibly remove personal data subject to legal and audit obligations.\n- WHEN an appeal is filed, THE system SHALL mark the case Appeal Pending and pause escalation timelines until a decision is issued.\n- WHEN an appeal is granted, THE system SHALL restore the prior permissible state and record the justification.\n- WHEN an appeal is denied, THE system SHALL maintain the sanction state and record the justification.\n- WHERE an account shows no activity for 12 months, THE system SHALL mark it Dormant and SHALL require re-verification on next login.\n\nNotifications\n- THE system SHALL notify users of state changes (verification, sanctions, appeals decisions, deletion, dormancy) using preferred channels per the [Functional Requirements Specification](./06-functional-requirements.md).\n\n## 8) Auditability and Transparency Requirements\n\n- THE system SHALL produce an immutable audit trail for security- and policy-relevant events: registrations, logins, logouts, token refreshes and revocations, password changes/resets, role assignments, sanctions, appeals decisions, email changes, MFA events, and recovery actions.\n- THE system SHALL capture for each audited event: actor (user or system), target (user/content), action, timestamp, outcome (success/failure), and justification where applicable.\n- WHERE personal data minimization is required, THE system SHALL record only the minimum necessary identifiers.\n- WHEN moderators or admins take actions affecting user content or state, THE system SHALL require entering a policy reference and rationale.\n- THE system SHALL provide role-appropriate audit access: moderators see case-relevant records; admins can run compliance reviews.\n- IF evidence (e.g., screenshots, links) is attached to a moderation action, THEN THE system SHALL preserve references consistent with the [Security, Privacy, and Compliance Requirements](./09-security-privacy-and-compliance.md).\n\n## 9) Non-Functional Expectations for Authentication\n\n- THE system SHALL respond to successful login within 2 seconds under normal load (p95) and 4 seconds under peak load (p95).\n- THE system SHALL deliver verification and reset emails within 2 minutes under normal conditions; retries SHALL occur for transient failures for up to 30 minutes.\n- THE system SHALL support immediate logout-all and device revocation propagation within 60 seconds p95.\n- THE system SHALL enforce rate limits for registration, login, reset, MFA, and recovery flows as defined in Sections 2.1, 2.3, 2.5, and 2.8–2.9.\n- WHERE service degradation occurs, THE system SHALL provide clear user-facing messages and safe fallback behaviors without exposing internal details.\n\n## 10) Detailed EARS Acceptance Criteria by Flow\n\n### 10.1 Registration and Verification\n- WHEN a user completes the sign-up form with a unique email and compliant password, THE system SHALL create an unverified account and send a verification email within 2 minutes.\n- IF the email is already registered, THEN THE system SHALL prevent account creation and present a non-enumerating message.\n- IF the verification link is invalid or expired, THEN THE system SHALL refuse verification and allow requesting a new link subject to rate limits.\n- WHEN verification is successful, THE system SHALL elevate the account to verified state and unlock standard interactions.\n\n### 10.2 Login, Logout, and Lockout\n- WHEN valid credentials are submitted, THE system SHALL issue tokens and create a session in less than 2 seconds.\n- IF invalid credentials are submitted, THEN THE system SHALL increment a failure counter and return an error without indicating which field is incorrect.\n- IF the account reaches 10 failed attempts in 15 minutes, THEN THE system SHALL impose a 15-minute lockout and notify the user’s email.\n- WHEN logout is requested, THE system SHALL invalidate the associated session’s refresh token within 60 seconds.\n- WHEN logout-all is requested, THE system SHALL invalidate all sessions for that user within 60 seconds.\n\n### 10.3 Password Reset and Change\n- WHEN a reset is requested, THE system SHALL send a reset link valid for 60 minutes and rate-limit to 3 per day per account.\n- WHEN a password is reset successfully, THE system SHALL revoke all sessions and require fresh login everywhere.\n- IF the new password fails complexity or reuse checks, THEN THE system SHALL reject the change with specific, actionable messages.\n- WHEN a password is changed by an authenticated user, THE system SHALL revoke all other device sessions within 60 seconds.\n\n### 10.4 Token Refresh and Reuse Detection\n- WHEN an access token expires, THE system SHALL allow refresh using a valid refresh token within its lifetime.\n- WHEN a refresh occurs, THE system SHALL rotate the refresh token and issue a new access token.\n- IF a refresh token is detected as reused, THEN THE system SHALL revoke the session and require full login.\n- WHERE clock skew is present, THE system SHALL tolerate up to 60 seconds skew without extending token lifetime.\n\n### 10.5 Multi-Factor Authentication\n- WHEN MFA is required, THE system SHALL prompt for a second factor before completing login.\n- IF MFA attempts fail 5 times within 15 minutes, THEN THE system SHALL apply a 15-minute cool-down and notify the account email.\n- WHERE a device is marked trusted, THE system SHALL bypass MFA on that device for up to 30 days unless risk signals require re-prompt.\n\n### 10.6 Email Change and Account Recovery\n- WHEN a user requests to change the email, THE system SHALL send confirmations to old and new emails and SHALL require confirmation within 24 hours to complete.\n- IF the email change is not confirmed within 24 hours, THEN THE system SHALL cancel the change and retain the old email.\n- WHEN account recovery is initiated, THE system SHALL restrict sensitive actions until recovery completes and SHALL record recovery steps in the audit trail.\n\n### 10.7 Session Idle Timeout and Re-Authentication for Sensitive Actions\n- WHILE a session is idle for 30 minutes, THE system SHALL expire interactive access and require re-authentication for further actions.\n- WHEN a sensitive action is attempted (e.g., password change, role change), THE system SHALL require recent re-authentication even if within the idle window.\n\n### 10.8 Authorization by Role\n- WHEN an action requires moderator privileges, THE system SHALL permit the action only if the session includes moderator or admin roles.\n- WHEN a fact-check annotation is submitted, THE system SHALL record the annotation and attribute it to the factChecker role user.\n- IF a user without verifiedMember status attempts to create an expert-tagged post, THEN THE system SHALL deny the action and indicate the verification requirement.\n\n## 11) Diagrams\n\n### 11.1 Authentication

If no pre-moderation is required, the post appears instantly. The member follows the thread, receives notifications for replies, and responds. The thread remains discoverable via topics and search.\n- Business Rules: Email verification is required to publish; content must conform to policy; rate limits apply; edits allowed in a short window (e.g., 15 minutes) without review; material changes after the window may require review.\n- Success Indicators: Publication ≤ 3 seconds; notifications ≤ 1 minute for direct replies; discoverability by selected topics.\n\n### 2) Verified Member hosts an expert Q&A (AMA)\n- Narrative: A verifiedMember schedules and posts an expert session tagged as \"expert\". Questions from members are collected; the host answers and cites sources. A summary note closes the session; the thread remains archived.\n- Business Rules: Expert tagging restricted to verifiedMember and above; standard policies and rate limits apply; tagging may increase prominence but never exempts policy.\n- Success Indicators: On-time start; proper question routing; visible summary; high-quality engagement with minimal intervention.\n\n### 3) Fact Checker annotates a claim\n- Narrative: A factChecker identifies a claim in a popular post, attaches an annotation with citations, and proposes a label such as \"unsupported\". Readers see the contextual note and sources. A moderator reviews and confirms the label; the author is notified and may revise.\n- Business Rules: Annotations are non-destructive; proposed enforcement-affecting labels require moderator confirmation.\n- Success Indicators: Annotation visible in ≤ 3 seconds; review completed within SLA; readers engage with sources.\n\n### 4) Member reports content; Moderator triages and enforces\n- Narrative: A member reports content for misinformation or harassment. The system assigns severity and routes to queues. A moderator reviews context and history, applies a proportionate action (dismiss, edit with note, warning, temporary mute, suspension), and logs rationale. Reporter and author are notified.\n- Business Rules: Reporter identity remains confidential to the author; sanctions follow configured ladders; appeals are available within a defined window.\n- Success Indicators: High-severity acknowledgement in minutes; decisions communicated clearly; low reversal rate on appeal.\n\n### 5) Admin manages categories and roles\n- Narrative: An admin creates categories for civic events, updates taxonomies, and assigns factChecker status to a qualified user. Changes take effect quickly and are audited. Affected users are notified.\n- Business Rules: Role changes require justification; taxonomy changes propagate to discovery and subscriptions; audits capture who, what, when, and why.\n- Success Indicators: No disruption to existing content; new categories visible; role changes reflect instantly in permissions.\n\n### 6) Member follows topics and receives updates\n- Narrative: A member follows civic topics. New posts in those topics trigger notifications and update a personalized feed. The member can unfollow at any time with immediate effect.\n- Business Rules: Follow capacity and rate limits apply; notification preferences are user-configurable.\n- Success Indicators: Timely, relevant notifications; accurate feed reflecting follow/unfollow.\n\n### 7) Author adopts a fact-check correction\n- Narrative: An author receives a notification that a claim in their post has an accepted annotation rated \"misleading\". The author revises the content with sources and submits. The revision is accepted; the label is updated to \"corrected\" and the post remains visible with a transparency note.\n- Business Rules: Correction path available to authors; material edits may require review; transparency note persists.\n- Success Indicators: Correction acknowledged within minutes; label updated; readers can see correction context.\n\n### 8) Digest notifications for busy topics\n- Narrative: A member opts into daily digests for a category. The system aggregates updates and sends a digest. The member can switch back to instant notifications.\n- Business Rules: Respect category preferences and quiet hours; deduplicate events; configurable cadence.\n- Success Indicators: Digest contains relevant items; opt-in/out takes effect within 1 minute.\n\n### 9) Moderator conflict-of-interest recusal\n- Narrative: A case assignment engine detects a potential conflict (recent sanctioning of the same author by the same moderator). The case is reassigned; the system records recusal.\n- Business Rules: Independence rule enforced for assignments and appeals.\n- Success Indicators: Reassignment within minutes; audit contains recusal reason and timestamp.\n\n### 10) Election window activation\n- Narrative: Admin activates an elevated-protection window for an upcoming election. Reports in relevant categories are prioritized with faster SLAs; political-content labels are enabled; transparency logs note the activation window.\n- Business Rules: Election windows elevate certain categories; labels and prioritization apply during activation period.\n- Success Indicators: Priority routing verified; SLA compliance improved on election-related items; visibility of labels.\n\n## Flow Illustrations\n\n### Report Intake and Triage (Happy Path)\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"User Action\"\n    A[\"Member Report Content(Select reason)\"] --> B[\"Submit Report\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"System Classification\"\n    C[\"Classify Severity\"] --> D{\"High Severity?\"}\n  end\n  subgraph \"Moderation\"\n    E[\"Queue Moderator\"] --> F[\"Review Context and History\"] --> G{\"Policy Violation?\"}\n    H[\"Apply Sanction(Warning/Mute/Suspension)\"] --> I[\"Notify Author and Reporter\"]\n    J[\"Dismiss Report\"] --> I\n  end\n  B --> C\n  D -->|\"Yes\"| E\n  D -->|\"No\"| E\n  E --> F\n  G -->|\"Yes\"| H\n  G -->|\"No\"| J\n```\n\n### Fact-Check Annotation Lifecycle\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Annotation\"\n    A[\"Select Claim Excerpt\"] --> B[\"Add Sources(Valid URLs)\"] --> C[\"Propose Rating(True/Needs Context/Misleading/False)\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Visibility & Review\"\n    D[\"Display Annotation Contextually\"] --> E{\"Enforcement-Affecting Label?\"}\n    E -->|\"Yes\"| F[\"Require Moderator Confirmation\"]\n    E -->|\"No\"| G[\"Visible Without Enforcement Change\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Outcomes\"\n    H[\"Accepted\"]\n    I[\"Contested\"]\n    J[\"Rejected\"]\n  end\n  C --> D\n  F --> H\n  G --> H\n  F -.-> I\n  D -.-> I\n  I --> K[\"Notify Author & FactChecker\"]\n  H --> K\n  J --> K\n```\n\n## Secondary and Special Scenarios (Edge Cases)\n\n### Editing window exceeded\n- Narrative: A member attempts to edit after the self-edit window.

workflows for civicDebateBoard enable consistent behavior across all core processes in clear business terms (WHAT to do). Technical implementations (architecture, APIs, database design, UI) remain at the discretion of the development team.\n\nRelated context for deeper background:\n- See narrative personas and examples in the [User Personas and Scenarios](./04-user-personas-and-scenarios.md).\n- Full capability rules are captured in the [Functional Requirements Specification](./06-functional-requirements.md).\n- Policy definitions and enforcement guardrails are established in the [Content Moderation and Safety Policies](./07-content-moderation-and-safety-policies.md).\n\n## Conventions and Roles Context\n- Roles: member, verifiedMember, factChecker, moderator, admin.\n- Content types: post, comment, reply, reaction, vote, report, annotation (fact-check), sanction, appeal, notification.\n- Time and localization: Interpret deadlines and timestamps in the user’s configured timezone; maintain canonical timestamps per business rules in the [Functional Requirements Specification](./06-functional-requirements.md).\n- EARS syntax: Applicable requirements use EARS keywords (WHEN, WHILE, IF, THEN, WHERE, THE, SHALL) in English; all descriptions in en-US.\n\n## Global Preconditions and Shared Behaviors\n\n### Authentication, Authorization, and State Gates\n- THE platform SHALL require authentication for actions that modify state (posting, commenting, voting, reporting, annotating, moderating, appealing).\n- THE platform SHALL evaluate role-based permissions and account state (active, muted, suspended, banned) before any mutating action.\n- WHERE ownership is required, THE platform SHALL verify the actor is the content owner within allowed windows.\n- WHEN a rate limit applies, THE platform SHALL calculate remaining quota and the next reset time and SHALL enforce the limit consistently across flows.\n\n### Idempotency, Concurrency, and Conflict Handling\n- WHEN repeated identical user actions occur within a short window (e.g., double-submit), THE platform SHALL process them idempotently so that only one effect is applied.\n- WHEN a concurrent update would create a conflict (e.g., editing content that changed since fetch), THE platform SHALL deny the action with a conflict reason and SHALL preserve the user’s latest attempt as a new draft when applicable.\n\n### Visibility States and Evidence\n- THE platform SHALL treat visibility states as: public, limited (e.g., pending review), hidden (author and staff only), removed (tombstoned), and restored; transitions follow policy.\n- THE platform SHALL capture immutable evidence snapshots for policy-relevant transitions (e.g., removal, label application, sanction issuance).\n\n### Audit and Notifications\n- THE platform SHALL record an immutable audit entry for actions affecting safety, visibility, roles, or account state.\n- WHEN user-impacting outcomes occur (publish, reject, label, sanction, appeal decision), THE notification service SHALL send outcomes consistent with user preferences and mandatory policy notices.\n\n## Posting and Editing Content Flow\n\n### Business Description\nMembers publish civic discussion posts with titles, body text, tags, and topics. Certain content routes to pre-moderation based on trust signals and policy flags. Authors may edit their own posts subject to time-bound and policy constraints. Verified members may mark content as expert when permitted.\n\n### Preconditions\n- Authenticated as member or above.\n- Account in good standing (not muted or suspended).\n- Sufficient rate-limit budget.\n\n### Primary Flow (Posting)\n1. Author creates a draft with required fields.\n2. System validates inputs and checks rate limits.\n3. System evaluates pre-moderation requirement.\n4.

Principles and Scope\n\n### Guiding Principles\n- Safety First: Protect users from harm, harassment, exploitation, and illegal activity.\n- Civility and Civic Value: Promote constructive, well-sourced debate and discourage manipulation.\n- Fairness and Consistency: Apply policies uniformly with documented rationales.\n- Transparency and Accountability: Provide clear reasons for actions and maintain auditability.\n- Due Process: Offer notice, the ability to appeal, and restorative options where appropriate.\n- Proportionality: Match enforcement severity to violation severity and user history.\n- Context Sensitivity: Consider intent, context, public-interest value, educational or newsworthiness exceptions.\n- Legal Compliance: Respect applicable laws and regulatory obligations across jurisdictions.\n\n### Scope of Application\n- Applies to all user-generated content (UGC): posts, comments, profile fields, attachments, links, tags, reactions, and account metadata disclosures.\n- Applies to all roles: member, verifiedMember, factChecker, moderator, admin.\n- Covers policy enforcement, user reporting, labeling and annotations, sanctions, transparency notices, appeals, audit trails, and emergency escalations.\n- Includes both proactive enforcement (e.g., automated pre-flagging) and reactive enforcement (e.g., user and partner reports).\n\n### Moderator Conduct and Recusal\n- Conflict of Interest: Moderators must recuse themselves from cases where impartiality may be compromised (e.g., personal relationships, prior disputes, organizational affiliations).\n- Professional Conduct: Decisions must reference policy categories, document rationales, and avoid personal or ideological commentary.\n- Independence of Appeals: Appeals must be reviewed by a different moderator or an admin for permanent bans.\n\n## Prohibited and Restricted Content Categories\n\nRestricted content requires labels, contextualization, age-gating, or limited distribution. Prohibited content requires removal and potential account sanctions. Context exceptions may apply for news reporting, educational materials, or public-interest documentation where clearly labeled and accompanied by context.\n\n| Category | Definition (business-level) | Status | Notes and Handling |\n|---------|------------------------------|--------|--------------------|\n| Illegal Content | Content that violates applicable laws (e.g., CSAM, explicit criminal facilitation) | Prohibited | Immediate removal and admin escalation; emergency escalation for child safety |\n| Child Exploitation | Any sexualization of minors, grooming, endangerment | Prohibited | Immediate removal; immediate emergency workflow activation and evidence preservation |\n| Terrorism and Extremism | Praise/support of designated extremist orgs or operational content | Prohibited | Removal; account sanctions; preserve evidence; consider law-enforcement referral |\n| Hate Speech | Direct attacks on protected classes (race, religion, gender identity, etc.) | Prohibited | Removal; strikes and sanctions calibrated by severity and context |\n| Harassment & Threats | Targeted harassment, credible threats, stalking, doxxing | Prohibited | Removal; urgent threat assessment and

Intimate Imagery | Sexual/explicit imagery shared without consent | Prohibited | Removal; immediate account suspension pending review |\n| Privacy Violations (Doxxing) | Publishing private identifying information without consent | Prohibited | Removal; evaluate imminent harm; rapid action |\n| Self-Harm and Suicide Promotion | Encouraging self-harm or suicide | Prohibited | Removal; provide crisis resources; supportive discussion allowed with guardrails |\n| Misinformation with Imminent Harm | False claims likely to cause real-world harm (health, safety, civic process) | Restricted/Prohibited | Label/reduce distribution or remove depending on harm/risk assessment |\n| Election Integrity Violations | Coordinated voter suppression, false voting logistics | Prohibited | Removal; high-priority escalation during election windows |\n| Medical Misinformation | Provably false medical claims contradicting leading public health bodies | Restricted | Label and reduce distribution; removal if imminently harmful |\n| Spam and Scams | Mass unsolicited content, phishing, financial scams | Prohibited | Removal; apply automated cool-down and strikes |\n| Platform Manipulation | Coordinated inauthentic behavior, astroturfing, vote brigading | Prohibited | Removal; deamplify; investigate related accounts |\n| Impersonation and Deceptive Identity | Misrepresenting identity or affiliation, deepfake impersonations | Restricted/Prohibited | Label or remove; require disclosure; sanction repeat abuse |\n| Copyright and Plagiarism | Unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted material | Restricted/Prohibited | Remove upon valid notice; repeat infringement may trigger suspension |\n| Adult Sexual Content | Explicit adult content | Restricted | Age-gate, label, and limit distribution; follow jurisdictional rules |\n| Sensitive Media | Disturbing but newsworthy content (e.g., war reporting) | Restricted | Allow with strong labels and click-through warnings |\n| Profanity and Rude Behavior | Non-targeted profanity | Allowed/Restricted | Allowed unless targeted; repeated abuse may trigger actions |\n| Off-Topic/Low-Quality | Content misaligned with civicDebateBoard’s civic discourse goals | Restricted | Downrank or move; removal after repeated abuse |\n| Synthetic/Manipulated Media | Materially deceptive edits without disclosure | Restricted/Prohibited | Require disclosure labels; remove where it causes imminent harm |\n\n### Category-Specific Handling Examples (Business)\n- Non-consensual intimate imagery: Fast-track to P0 with immediate content removal and temporary account disable pending review.\n- Election-related false logistics (e.g., wrong voting date): P0 during election windows; remove and apply strikes; add corrective banner when appropriate.\n- Newsworthy graphic content (e.g., war crimes documentation): Allow with strong interstitial labels and age-gating; limit distribution.\n\n## Civic Discourse Safeguards (Election Integrity and Misinformation Handling)\n\n### Core Safeguards\n- Election Windows: Elevated protections start 90 days before and end 14 days after scheduled elections relevant to the user’s locale.\n- Claim Typology: Distinguish factual claims from opinion/analysis; apply annotations only on factual claims.\n- Source Citation: Encourage references to credible sources for significant civic claims and expert-tagged posts.\n- Distribution Controls: Reduce distribution of labeled misinformation, prevent trending and recommendations, and consider comment limits for high-risk items.\n- Entity Disclosure: Label accounts that disclose affiliations to campaigns, governments, or NGOs; require disclosure for official spokespeople.\n\n### Fact-Checking and Annotations\n- factChecker Role: Add claim-level annotations, ratings (true/misleading/unfounded/needs context), and citations; cannot sanction directly.\n- Moderator Review: Apply labels, reduce distribution, or remove content based on harm assessment and policy fit; require citation alignment.\n- Author and Reader Notice: Notify authors upon annotation/labeling; show concise summaries with links to sources for readers.\n\n## Report Intake and Prioritization\n\n### Intake Channels and Metadata\n- In-line Content Reports: Reporting from content context with category selection and optional notes.\n- Out-of-Content Reports: Reports on profiles/messages via dedicated reporting entry.\n- System Flags: Automated signals (burst activity, new-account patterns) that generate reports.\n- Trusted Partner Reports: Pre-vetted organizations submitting high-priority notices for categories such as election integrity and child safety.\n\n### False-Report and Reporter Abuse Handling\n- Bad-Faith Reporting: Repeated inaccurate or harassing reports are a form of abuse.\n- Reporter Reputation: Reporter accuracy is tracked to weight prioritization; chronic abusers may face limits.\n\n### Prioritization Rubric\n- Severity Tiers:\n  - Critical (P0): Child safety, credible violent threats, voter suppression, non-consensual intimate imagery.\n  - High (P1): Hate speech, doxxing, terrorism support, imminent-harm misinformation.\n  - Medium (P2): Harassment, platform manipulation, medical misinformation without imminent harm, copyright notices.\n  - Low (P3): Spam, off-topic, profanity, low-quality content.\n- Reporter Trust Weighting: Reports by verifiedMember, factChecker, moderator, and trusted partners receive elevated priority.\n- Recency/Velocity: Recent posts with high engagement escalate within tier.\n- Duplicate Report Merging: Multiple reports for the same item are aggregated; unique reporter count influences priority.\n\n### Triage Workflow (Business-Level)\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Report Intake\"\n    A[\"User/System Submits Report\"] --> B[\"Capture Metadata(Category, Notes, Reporter Role)\"]\n    B --> C[\"Assign Severity Tier(P0-P3)\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Queueing\"\n    C --> D[\"Merge Duplicates\"]\n    D --> E[\"Apply Priority Weighting\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Review\"\n    E --> F{\"Harm Likely?\"}\n    F -->|\"Yes\"| G[\"Fast-Track to Moderator\"]\n    F -->|\"No\"| H[\"Standard Queue\"]\n  end\n  G --> I[\"Immediate Interim Action(Label/Hide)\"]\n  H --> I\n  I --> J[\"Assignment to Reviewer\"]\n```\n\n## Review SLAs and Escalation Paths\n\n### Service-Level Objectives (business expectations)\n- Continuous review operations with enhanced responsiveness during civic or emergency periods.\n\n| Severity | First Action Deadline (from report) | Final Decision Deadline | Escalation Trigger |\n|----------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|\n| P0 Critical | 15 minutes | 2 hours | Immediate escalation to senior moderator; admin if legal risk or ongoing harm |\n| P1 High | 1 hour | 12 hours | Escalate if backlog > 1 hour or repeat violations |\n| P2 Medium | 6 hours | 48 hours | Escalate if trending or duplicates exceed 10 |\n| P3 Low | 24 hours | 5 days | Escalate if duplicates exceed 25 or author has 3+ recent strikes |\n| Election Window P0 | 10 minutes | 1 hour | Auto-notify admin and factChecker group |\n\n### Escalation Paths (business logic)\n- Moderator → Senior Moderator: Triggered by severity thresholds, legal sensitivity, repeated violations, or conflict of interest.\n- Senior Moderator → Admin: Triggered by legal obligations, public-interest exceptions, government requests, or platform-wide risk.\n- Emergency Referral: Child safety or credible threats to life follow emergency process with immediate action and post-facto review.\n- Legal Requests: Potential law-enforcement requests are logged and handled by admins consistent with compliance requirements.\n\n## Sanctions and Transparency\n\n### Sanction Types and Durations\n\n| Sanction | Description | Default Duration | Applicability |\n|----------|-------------|------------------|---------------|\n| Content Removal | Remove violating content | Permanent | All prohibited categories |\n| Warning | Formal notice for minor or first-time violations | N/A | P2–P3 violations |\n| Labeling | Add context labels or fact-check notes | Until resolved/updated | Misinformation, sensitive media |\n| Limited Participation | Reduce posting/comment cadence (cool-down) | 24–72 hours | Harassment, spam, low-quality |\n| Temporary Mute | Block posting/commenting | 24 hours to 14 days | Repeated harassment, hate speech |\n| Shadow Deamplification | Reduce distribution without blocking access | 7–30 days | Manipulation, low-quality |\n| Temporary Suspension | Disable account access | 7–30 days | Severe or repeated violations |\n| Permanent Ban | Terminate account | Permanent | CSAM, extremism, chronic abuse |\n\n### Sanction Ladder by Category (Default Calibration)\n\n| Category Group | First Confirmed Violation | Second Within 90 Days | Third Within 90 Days |\n|----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| P3 Minor (spam, low-quality, profanity) | Warning or limited participation(24h) | Limited participation(72h) | Temporary mute(24–72h) |\n| P2 Moderate (harassment non-targeted, copyright on notice) | Content removal + warning | Temporary mute(24–72h) | Temporary suspension(7d) |\n| P1 Severe (hate speech, doxxing, extremism support non-operational) | Content removal + temporary suspension(7–14d) | Suspension(14–30d) + strike | Suspension(30d) + ban review |\n| P0 Critical (child safety, non-consensual intimate imagery, credible threats, voter suppression) | Immediate disable + ban review | Permanent ban | Permanent ban |\n\nStrike Policy\n- Three-strike escalation: Three P1 violations within 90 days lead to 30-day suspension; any confirmed P0 triggers immediate permanent ban review.\n- Strike Decay: Strikes older than 180 days are excluded from automatic escalations.\n\n### Role-Based Authority\n- moderator: Remove content, issue warnings, apply labels, impose limited participation, apply temporary mutes/suspensions up to 14 days, and escalate to admin.\n- admin: All moderator actions plus suspensions up to permanent ban, policy configuration, and exception approvals.\n- factChecker: Add annotations and propose labels; cannot apply sanctions.\n- verifiedMember and member: Report content and appeal sanctions on their own content.\n\n### Transparency and User Notice\n- Action Notices: Clear reason, policy category, evidence summary, and appeal option with deadlines.\n- Public Transparency Log: Anonymized aggregate statistics published periodically (counts by category, sanction type, resolution time) without exposing personal data.\n- Remediation Guidance: Provide corrective steps where appropriate (e.g., edit with context, cite sources).\n\n## Evidence Handling and Audit Trails\n\n- Evidence Capture: Preserve exact content, timestamps, author identifiers, reporter role, and context pointers at report and enforcement times.\n- Chain of Custody: Record each handling step with actor role, action type, timestamp, and rationale.\n- Retention: Keep evidence for at least 365 days from final resolution, or longer if required by law or active appeal.\n- Access Control: Restrict evidence access to moderators and admins; factCheckers may view content context for annotations but not sensitive personal data.\n- Redaction: Redact personal identifiers from case summaries shared beyond the moderation team.\n\n## Appeals and Restorative Processes\n\n- Appeal Window: 14 days for most sanctions; 7 days for election-related actions.\n- Independent Review: By a reviewer different from the original decision-maker; admins review permanent-ban appeals.\n- Restorative Options: Educational prompts, edits, or contextualization to reinstate visibility when policy allows.\n- Outcome Notifications: Clear decisions with updated rationales and references to policy categories.\n- Rate Limits: One appeal per decision unless new evidence emerges.\n\n### Appeals Workflow (Business-Level)\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Appeal Submission\"\n    A[\"User Submits Appeal\"] --> B[\"Validate Eligibility(Window, Single Appeal)\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Review and Decision\"\n    B --> C[\"Assign Different Reviewer\"]\n    C --> D{\"Uphold or Overturn?\"}\n  end\n  D -->|\"Uphold\"| E[\"Notify User and Maintain Sanction\"]\n  D -->|\"Overturn\"| F[\"Reinstate Content/Access and Clear Strike\"]\n  E --> G[\"Log Outcome in Audit Trail\"]\n  F --> G\n```\n\n## EARS-Formatted Enforcement Requirements\n\n### General Policy Application\n- THE moderation system SHALL apply the most severe applicable policy category when multiple categories are triggered by the same content.\n- THE moderation system SHALL preserve a snapshot of content and metadata at the time of report and at the time of enforcement.\n- THE moderation system SHALL record actor role, action, timestamp, and rationale for every enforcement action.\n\n### Reporting and Intake\n- WHEN a user submits a report with a selected category, THE moderation system SHALL capture category, free-text notes up to 1,000 characters, reporter role, and timestamp.\n- WHEN duplicate reports target the same content, THE moderation system SHALL merge them into a single case while preserving reporter counts and roles.\n- WHERE the reporter is a trusted partner or factChecker, THE moderation system SHALL assign at least P1 priority unless the content already has P0 triggers.\n- WHILE content is under review for P0 or P1, THE moderation system SHALL prevent the content from appearing in recommendations and trending lists.\n- WHERE a reporter’s recent accuracy rate falls below 20% over 30 days, THE moderation system SHALL downgrade the reporter’s prioritization weight and may apply reporting cooldowns.\n- IF a reporter submits harassing or fraudulent reports repeatedly (≥ 5 invalid reports within 7 days), THEN THE moderation system SHALL impose a reporting cooldown of at least 72 hours and SHALL record a strike against reporter abuse.\n\n### Prioritization and SLAs\n- WHEN a report is categorized as P0, THE moderation system SHALL present it to a moderator within 15 minutes and record the presentation timestamp.\n- WHEN a report is categorized as P1, THE moderation system SHALL present it to a moderator within 1 hour.\n- WHEN a report is categorized as P2, THE moderation

THE moderation system SHALL apply the Election Window SLA table to P0 items.\n\n### Interim Actions and Labels\n- WHEN harm assessment is pending for P0 or P1, THE moderation system SHALL allow moderators to apply interim actions: temporary hide, label, or limit distribution, with rationale capture.\n- WHERE content is labeled as misinformation, THE moderation system SHALL show fact-check annotations and reduce distribution for the labeled item until updated or removed.\n- WHERE synthetic/manipulated media lacks disclosure, THE moderation system SHALL apply a disclosure label and limit distribution pending author correction or moderator decision.\n\n### Sanctions and Strikes\n- WHEN content is removed for a Prohibited category, THE moderation system SHALL add one strike to the author’s account with category and date.\n- WHERE a user accrues three P1 strikes within 90 days, THE moderation system SHALL apply a 30-day suspension.\n- IF a P0 violation is confirmed, THEN THE moderation system SHALL disable the account pending admin review for permanent ban.\n- WHERE a strike becomes older than 180 days, THE moderation system SHALL exclude it from automatic escalation calculations.\n- WHEN a warning is issued, THE moderation system SHALL record it without adding a strike.\n- WHERE violation category maps to the sanction ladder, THE moderation system SHALL apply the default sanction unless an admin-approved exception is recorded with rationale.\n\n### Role-Based Permissions and Recusal\n- WHERE the actor role is moderator, THE moderation system SHALL permit content removal, warnings, labels, limited participation, mutes up to 14 days, and suspensions up to 14 days.\n- WHERE the actor role is admin, THE moderation system SHALL permit permanent bans and configuration of sanction durations and policies.\n- WHERE the actor role is factChecker, THE moderation system SHALL permit creating annotations and proposing labels but SHALL prohibit sanctions.\n- WHEN a moderator is assigned a case that presents a conflict of interest, THE moderation system SHALL allow and record recusal and SHALL reassign the case automatically.\n\n### Transparency and Notices\n- WHEN an enforcement action is applied, THE moderation system SHALL notify the author with the policy category, a concise explanation up to 500 characters, evidence summary reference, and

prevent edits.\n- WHERE a case is accessed by a reviewer, THE moderation system SHALL log the access with role and purpose.\n- IF an appeal overturns a decision, THEN THE moderation system SHALL link the new decision to the original case and mark the original rationale as superseded.\n- WHERE a legal hold is established, THE moderation system SHALL suspend routine deletion of relevant evidence until the hold is lifted.\n\n### Appeals and Restorative Processes\n- WHEN a user appeals within the allowed window, THE moderation system SHALL route the case to a different reviewer.\n- WHERE a decision is upheld, THE moderation system SHALL allow exactly one appeal per decision unless new evidence is attached.\n- WHERE a restorative option is offered, THE moderation system SHALL reinstate content visibility upon completion or compliant edits.\n- WHEN a permanent ban appeal is granted, THE moderation system SHALL downgrade sanctions to suspension and SHALL define a probation period of

evaluates and coordinates any legally required referrals.\n\n### Moderator Conflict-of-Interest Handling\n- Automatic prompts for recusal on signals like prior direct interactions or declared affiliations; reassignment recorded in audit.\n\n## User-Facing Error and Recovery Scenarios (Business)\n- Misfiled Report: Reporter selects wrong category. Outcome: Case remains valid; category can be corrected by reviewer; reporter receives outcome summary regardless.\n- Sanctioned While Posting: User starts writing before sanction and attempts to publish during sanction. Outcome: Publish denied with remaining sanction duration; draft preserved.\n- Label Dispute: Author disagrees with misinformation label. Outcome: Appeal path available; upon successful appeal, label removed and strike cleared.\n\n## Policy Versioning and Change Management\n- Versioned Policies: Each enforcement references a policy version identifier.\n- Change Notices: Material policy changes communicated to users; moderators briefed prior to enforcement; transparency report notes effective dates.\n\n## Related Documents\n- Refer to the [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./03-user-roles-and-authentication.md) for role definitions and session behaviors.\n- Refer to the [User Flows and Processes Guide](./05-user-flows-and-processes.md) for end-to-end business workflows.\n- Refer to the [Security, Privacy, and Compliance Requirements](./09-security-privacy-and-compliance.md) for privacy, security, and legal obligations.\n"},{"reason":"Set measurable expectations for performance, availability, scalability, and operability from a user-experience perspective.","filename":"08-non-functional-requirements-and-slas.md","documentType":"requirement","outline":["Performance Targets (response time by scenario)","Availability and Reliability Objectives","Capacity and Scalability Goals","Rate Limiting and Fair-Use Policies","Observability Expectations (logging, metrics, alerting in business terms)","Backup and Disaster Recovery Objectives (RTO/RPO)","Internationalization and Timezone Considerations","EARS-Formatted Non-Functional Requirements"],"audience":"development team","keyQuestions":["What performance should users experience in common and peak scenarios?","What availability and recovery objectives are required?","How should fair use be enforced?"],"detailLevel":"detailed specification","relatedDocuments":["06-functional-requirements.md","09-security-privacy-and-compliance.md"],"constraints":["All targets must be specific and measurable","Use EARS where applicable","Avoid architecture or technology prescriptions"],"content":"# Non-Functional Requirements and SLAs — civicDebateBoard\n\n## Performance Targets (response time by scenario)\n\nPerformance targets use percentile-based latency measured at the service boundary from user request receipt to first byte of server response. Targets exclude end-user network variability and device rendering but include all server-side processing and coordinated async acknowledgements documented as user-observable outcomes. Baseline, peak, and surge windows are defined to reflect civic-event dynamics.\n\n### Core Read Scenarios\n- Thread view (initial load of a discussion with first page of comments)\n  - p95 ≤ 1.0 s; p99 ≤ 2.0 s\n  - Subsequent page loads in same thread: p95 ≤ 0.8 s; p99 ≤ 1.5 s\n- Topic/Category feed listing (first page)\n  - p95 ≤ 1.0 s; p99 ≤ 2.0 s\n  - Pagination/“next” fetches: p95 ≤ 0.7 s; p99 ≤ 1.4 s\n- Notifications list fetch (latest 50 items)\n  - p95 ≤ 0.8 s; p99 ≤ 1.5 s\n- User profile read (public view)\n  - p95 ≤ 0.7 s; p99 ≤ 1.2 s\n\n### Write and Interaction Scenarios\n- Create post (including server-side validations and topic/tag processing)\n  - p95 ≤ 1.2 s; p99 ≤ 2.5 s\n- Edit post within allowed policy window\n  - p95 ≤ 1.0 s; p99 ≤ 2.0 s\n- Create comment or reply\n  - p95 ≤ 0.9 s; p99 ≤ 1.8 s\n- Add reaction (like/support) or cast vote\n  - p95 ≤ 0.5 s; p99 ≤ 1.0 s\n  - Cross-device reflection (eventual consistency): visible to the same user’s other sessions within 2.0 s (p95) and 5.0 s (p99)\n- Report content (submit report with category and notes)\n  - p95 ≤ 0.8 s; p99 ≤ 1.5 s\n- Fact-check annotation submission (by factChecker)\n  - p95 ≤ 1.2 s; p99 ≤ 2.5 s\n\n### Search and Discovery\n- Simple search (keyword over titles/content, default filters)\n  - p95 ≤ 1.5 s; p99 ≤ 3.0 s\n- Advanced search (multiple filters such as date range, tags, author)\n  - p95 ≤ 2.5 s; p99 ≤ 5.0 s\n- Autocomplete suggestions (typeahead)\n  - p95 ≤ 0.3 s; p99 ≤ 0.6 s\n\n### Authentication and Account Management (business perspective)\n- Login with valid credentials\n  - p95 ≤ 2.0 s; p99 ≤ 4.0 s\n- Email verification link consumption\n  - p95 ≤ 1.0 s; p99 ≤ 2.0 s\n- Password reset flow (token validation and new password set)\n  - p95 ≤ 2.0 s; p99 ≤ 4.0 s\n\n### Background and Asynchronous Outcomes (user-observable)\n- Notification delivery for direct mentions and replies\n  - p95 ≤ 10 s; p99 ≤ 30 s from event occurrence\n- Moderation decision visibility after decision recorded\n  - p95 ≤ 10 s; p99 ≤ 60 s to all relevant views\n- Indexing latency for search after new content\n  - p95 ≤ 30 s; p99 ≤ 120 s\n\n### Concurrency and Throughput Assumptions (business-facing)\n- Baseline steady state: 10,000 concurrent authenticated users, 2,000 read requests/s, 500 write requests/s\n- Peak predictable events (e.g., election nights): up to 50,000 concurrent users, 10,000 read requests/s, 2,000 write requests/s\n- Short surge (≤ 10 minutes) due to breaking news: up to 2× peak for reads and 1.5× peak for writes\n- Targets SHALL hold under baseline; during peak/surge windows, p95 and p99 targets may degrade by at most +30% latency while maintaining availability objectives\n\n### Cold-Start and Cache Warm-Up Behavior\n- First access after cache cold start for any high-volume listing (topic feed, home feed) may incur up to +20% additional latency at p95 for ≤ 5 minutes after deployment or failover; p99 must remain within +30% of baseline.\n- Warm cache steady-state must regain baseline targets within 5 minutes of stabilization.\n\n### Payload and Pagination Consistency Expectations\n- Result pages for feeds and search SHALL contain 20 items by default with stable sorting and no duplicates across contiguous pages under the same query parameters.\n- Aggregated counters (reactions, votes) may be eventually consistent across sessions but MUST converge within 5 seconds at p99 for the acting user’s view.\n\n## Availability and Reliability Objectives\n\nAvailability targets are measured monthly unless specified. Availability is the proportion of successful user operations over total attempted operations for the capability, excluding client-originated failures outside the service boundary and scheduled maintenance within the announced window.\n\n### Service-Level Objectives (SLOs)\n- Core read operations (view thread, list feeds): 99.95% monthly availability\n- Core write operations (create/edit posts/comments, vote/reaction): 99.90% monthly availability\n- Authentication and session operations: 99.90% monthly availability\n- Search services: 99.90% monthly availability\n\n### Error Budgets and Release Governance\n- 99.95% monthly leaves 21.6 minutes unavailability budget; 99.90% leaves 43.8 minutes.\n- At 50% budget consumption: restrict non-critical changes and require explicit approval for risk-elevating deployments.\n- At 100% consumption: freeze non-emergency changes until budget resets.\n\n#### Change Freeze Trigger Flow\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Track Error Budget Consumption\"] --> B{\"Reached 50%?\"}\n  B -->|\"Yes\"| C[\"Restrict Non-Critical Changes\"]\n  B -->|\"No\"| D[\"Continue Normal Changes\"]\n  C --> E{\"Reached 100%?\"}\n  D --> E\n  E -->|\"Yes\"| F[\"Freeze Non-Emergency Changes\"]\n  E -->|\"No\"| G[\"Monitor & Reassess Daily\"]\n```\n\n### Maintenance Windows\n- Planned maintenance up to 60 minutes per month, scheduled at low-traffic times and announced at least 72 hours in advance with local-time communication for impacted regions.\n- Prefer degraded-mode maintenance (read-only) over full downtime with clear user notices.\n\n### Graceful Degradation Expectations\n- Prioritize read availability over non-critical write operations and background tasks during impairments.\n- Temporarily disable heavy, non-essential features (e.g., bulk data exports) to protect core SLOs.\n\n### SLA Measurement and Reporting\n- Measurement window: monthly calendar period with daily rollups.\n- Inclusion criteria: successful operations are those completed within published latency and functional correctness; degraded but retried within the same interaction counts as success if within user-visible SLA.\n- Exclusions: client-side network errors, third-party outages beyond control with documented supplier incident references, and scheduled maintenance communicated ≥ 72 hours in advance.\n- Reporting: publish monthly availability summaries per capability with error budget status and top contributing incidents.\n\n### User-Facing Status Communications\n- Incident status pages and in-product banners must reflect current impact, affected capabilities, start time, and next update ETA.\n- Update cadence: every 30 minutes for active major incidents; every 60 minutes for minor incidents until resolved.\n\n## Capacity and Scalability Goals\n\n- Planning horizon: 12 months rolling with quarterly review.\n- Headroom policy: maintain ≥ 30% spare capacity over the 95th percentile observed demand; ≥ 50% during known high-impact civic events.\n- Elasticity: scale-out actions commence within 2 minutes of sustained (≥ 5 minutes) demand beyond headroom; scale-in after 30 minutes of sub-70% utilization to avoid thrashing.\n- Data growth assumptions: 1–2 million new posts/month, 10–20 million new comments/month; proportional growth in reactions and votes.\n- Multi-tenant fairness: per-topic or per-region spikes must not starve other topics/regions; apply isolation and quotas to protect fairness.\n\n### Data Consistency and Backlog Management\n- Async backlogs (notifications, indexing) must drain to within normal operating thresholds within 15 minutes after surge subsides.\n- Search indexing lag must meet p95 ≤ 30 s; p99 ≤ 120 s under steady-state and return to targets within 10 minutes post-surge.\n\n## Rate Limiting and Fair-Use Policies\n\nRate limits protect platform health and fairness. Limits are enforced per authenticated user and, where applicable, per-IP to mitigate abuse. Role-specific limits reflect trust and responsibility. Administrative and moderation functions necessary for safety are exempt from general content-creation caps but remain subject to platform protection.\n\n### Action-Based Daily Quotas by Role\n\n| Action (per 24h rolling window) | member | verifiedMember | factChecker | moderator | admin |\n|---------------------------------|--------|----------------|-------------|-----------|-------|\n| Create posts                    | 30     | 60             | 60          | 120       | 240   |\n| Comments/replies                | 300    | 600            | 600         | 1,200     | 2,400 |\n| Reactions (likes/support)       | 3,000  | 5,000          | 5,000       | 10,000    | 20,000|\n| Votes (polls/ballots)           | 1,000  | 2,000          | 2,000       | 5,000     | 10,000|\n| Reports submitted               | 100    | 200            | 300         | 5,000     | 5,000 |\n| Fact-check annotations          | —      | —              | 100         | 300       | 300   |\n| Data exports (on-demand)        | 2      | 2              | 4           | 10        | 20    |\n\nNotes:\n- “—” denotes action not available to that role.\n- High-volume administrative operations affecting many items may require additional confirmations and audit entries per safety and compliance policies.\n\n### Per-User and Per-IP Request Shaping\n- Sustained per-user request rate: 60 requests/minute with burst up to 3× for 10 seconds; cooldown applies if exceeded.\n- Per-IP guideline: 120 requests/minute with burst up to 3× for 10 seconds; stricter thresholds may apply for shared networks with abusive patterns.\n- Search-specific limit per minute/hour: 20/100 (member), 40/200 (verifiedMember), 60/300 (factChecker), 120/600 (moderator/admin).\n\n### Abuse Response and Recovery\n- Progressive throttling: soft warnings → temporary slowdowns → temporary blocks within the same 24h window; resets after the rolling window elapses.\n- Human verification may be required when automated abuse signals exceed thresholds.\n- Accuracy-weighted reporting: frequent inaccurate reporters may see reduced report quotas until accuracy improves per moderation policies.\n\n## Observability Expectations (business terms)\n\nObservability enables rapid detection, triage, and resolution of issues to protect user experience and SLAs. Expectations are stated as outcomes and signal categories, not tooling.\n\n### Business Event Logging\n- Authentication events: registration, login success/failure, logout, email verification, password reset, device/session revocation.\n- Content lifecycle: post/comment creation, edits, deletions, restores, visibility changes (e.g., moderation actions), tagging/topic updates.\n- User safety: reports, triage outcomes, sanctions applied, appeals and outcomes.\n- Configuration and policy changes: role assignments, feature toggles, category/tag configuration, sanctions configuration.\n- Elevated data access: exports and policy audits.\n\nLogs include sufficient context to trace who acted, what changed, and when, with privacy compliance consistent with security and compliance requirements.\n\n### Metrics and Health Indicators\n- Latency distributions: p50/p95/p99 for key flows defined in Performance Targets.\n- Availability: success rate per capability excluding client/network errors.\n- Saturation: high-level indicators (queue depth, worker utilization) of constrained capacity.\n- Workload: request rates, concurrency, job backlogs.\n- Operability KPIs: report backlog age, moderation decision latency, notification delivery latency.\n\n### Alerting and Operational Response\n- Thresholds mapped to SLOs and user impact:\n  - Critical: page immediately when projected to breach SLO within 30 minutes or user-visible errors exceed 2% for 5 minutes.\n  - High: page when p99 latency exceeds target by 50% for 10 minutes under baseline.\n  - Moderate: ticket for chronic degradations without immediate user impact.\n- On-call availability: 24/7 coverage with acknowledgement within 5 minutes (critical) and 15 minutes (high); mitigation or rollback initiated within 15 minutes (critical) and 30 minutes (high).\n- Post-incident review: completed within 5 business days with action items tracked to completion.\n\n#### Incident Alerting and Escalation Flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant U as \"User Experience\"\n  participant M as \"Metrics/Alerts\"\n  participant OC as \"On-Call Engineer\"\n  participant IM as \"Incident

Release Governance\n- Release windows: prefer low-traffic times aligned to major user regions; avoid scheduled releases during published election windows.\n- Canary/gradual rollout expectations: progressive exposure with rollback criteria tied to SLO deltas and error budget consumption.\n- Rollback targets: decision within 15 minutes of critical alert if regression persists.\n\n## Backup and Disaster Recovery Objectives (RTO/RPO)\n\n- Backup coverage: user-generated content, policy configurations, and audit records required for legal and operational accountability.\n- Backup frequency: at least every 15 minutes for critical transactional data; daily immutable snapshots for full datasets.\n- Retention: minimum 30 days online; 180 days in archive for compliance-relevant records, subject to privacy obligations.\n- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): ≤ 15 minutes for critical data; ≤ 60 minutes for non-critical indexes and caches.\n- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): ≤ 60 minutes for single-region outages affecting core operations; ≤ 4 hours for full regional failover.\n- Restore testing: quarterly restore drills for critical datasets with evidence of success and measured RTO/RPO compliance.\n\n#### Disaster Recovery Decision Flow\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Degradation or Outage Detected\"] --> B{\"Within Error Budget?\"}\n  B -->|\"Yes\"| C[\"Mitigate and Monitor\"]\n  B

Considerations\n\n- Timestamps are displayed in the user’s configured timezone and locale formats, with an option to view in UTC.\n- Relative time phrasing is acceptable when unambiguous and accompanied by absolute time upon request.\n- Daylight saving and regional calendar differences are respected for date ranges and limits.\n- Rolling windows for rate limits are anchored to UTC for fairness and predictability; user interfaces communicate remaining quotas in the user’s timezone.\n- Notifications and scheduled communications respect the recipient’s local quiet hours where configured.\n- Regional incident communications are localized to impacted regions’ local time with clear conversion to UTC for audit.\n\n## EARS-Formatted Non-Functional Requirements\n\n###

requirements for security, privacy, and compliance for the civicDebateBoard service. It specifies WHAT the system must do from a compliance and safety perspective in clear, testable terms, without prescribing HOW to implement it. All technical implementation decisions (architecture, APIs, database design, cryptographic choices, tooling) are at the discretion of the development team.\n\n## Introduction and Scope\ncivicDebateBoard facilitates civic discourse with roles [member, verifiedMember, factChecker, moderator, admin]. This document governs how user data is handled, how access is controlled, how activities are audited, and how incidents are managed to meet legal and ethical obligations across jurisdictions in which the service operates. Requirements herein are expressed in business terms and must be treated as mandatory acceptance criteria.\n\n- In-Scope: Data privacy obligations, consent management, user rights, business-level security expectations, audit logging, incident response, regulatory conformance, third-party risk.\n- Out-of-Scope: UI/UX specifications, API endpoints, database schemas, cryptographic algorithms, network or infrastructure choices.\n\nFor role definitions and session behaviors, see the User Roles and Authentication Requirements in [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./03-user-roles-and-authentication.md). For performance, availability, and disaster recovery expectations, see [Non-Functional Requirements and SLAs](./08-non-functional-requirements-and-slas.md).\n\n## Data Privacy Principles and Consent Management\ncivicDebateBoard adheres to the following privacy principles: purpose limitation, data minimization, transparency, integrity and confidentiality, storage limitation, and accountability. Consent is one lawful basis among others (e.g., contract, legitimate interest) and must be handled explicitly when required.\n\n### Data Categories and Classification (Business View)\n| Category | Examples | Sensitivity | Default Collection | Default Sharing |\n|---------|----------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Account Data | email, display name, role, verification status | Personal | Required for account | Not shared externally |\n| Content Data | posts, comments, reactions, bookmarks | Varies (may include personal) | Optional per user action | Public if posted publicly |\n| Behavioral Data | follows, subscriptions, notification preferences, rate-limit counters | Personal | Limited to service operation | Not shared externally |\n| Security Data | login events, device sessions, password reset requests, sanctions | Personal | Required for security | Not shared externally |\n| Moderation Data | reports, review decisions, sanctions, appeals | Personal | Required for policy enforcement | Not shared externally |\n| Analytics Data | aggregated usage metrics | Aggregated/De-identified | Optional per consent where required | Shared only in aggregate |\n\n### Privacy Disclosures and Consent\n- Transparency: Users must receive clear disclosures about purposes of processing, categories of data collected, retention periods, and sharing practices at or before the point of collection.\n- Consent: Explicit consent must be obtained before processing categories that require consent by law (e.g., certain analytics, marketing communications, location-based personalization where applicable). Consent must be granular, freely given, informed, unambiguous, and revocable at any time without detriment.\n- Legitimate Interest: Where legitimate interest is used as a lawful basis, a documented balancing test must be maintained and users must be offered an easy opt-out when required.\n\n### Cookie/Identifier Preferences and \"Do Not Sell/Share\"\n- Cookie and identifier preferences must be honored, including Global Privacy Control (GPC) or similar browser-level signals where applicable.\n- Marketing communications and cross-context behavioral advertising must be opt-in where required and opt-out at minimum elsewhere; non-discrimination rules apply.\n\n### EARS Requirements — Privacy and Consent\n- THE civicDebateBoard SHALL present purpose-specific privacy disclosures prior to any data collection that is not strictly necessary for core service operation.\n- THE civicDebateBoard SHALL record the timestamp, scope, and version of the disclosure accepted by the user for any consent-based processing.\n- WHEN a user withdraws consent for a processing purpose, THE civicDebateBoard SHALL cease that processing within 24 hours and ensure no new data is collected for that purpose thereafter.\n- WHEN consent is required for analytics beyond strictly necessary operations, THE civicDebateBoard SHALL default to opt-out and SHALL enable opt-in only after explicit user action.\n- IF a processing purpose changes materially, THEN THE civicDebateBoard SHALL obtain fresh consent before continuing consent-based processing under the new purpose.\n- WHERE legal bases other than consent are relied upon, THE civicDebateBoard SHALL expose a clear explanation of the applicable legal basis within the privacy notice.\n- WHERE a GPC or equivalent signal is received, THE civicDebateBoard SHALL treat it as a valid opt-out of sale/share for applicable jurisdictions and SHALL persist that preference.\n\n### Consent Lifecycle (Business Flow)\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Collect Purpose-Specific Disclosure\"] --> B[\"Capture Consent State(Opt-in/Opt-out)\"]\n  B --> C{\"Consent Required?\"}\n  C -->|\"Yes\"| D[\"Enforce Purpose Access Controls\"]\n  C -->|\"No\"| E[\"Proceed Under Other Legal Basis\"]\n  D --> F{\"Withdrawal Requested?\"}\n  F -->|\"Yes\"| G[\"Stop Processing(<24h) & Log Withdrawal\"]\n  F -->|\"No\"| H[\"Continue Processing\"]\n  E --> H\n```\n\n## User Rights (Access, Correction, Deletion)\nUser rights procedures must ensure timely, secure, and verifiable fulfillment of requests.\n\n### Identity Verification for Requests\n- Requests to access, correct, or delete data must be verified using reasonable methods proportionate to the sensitivity of the data and the risk of harm from unauthorized access. The verification method must not require excessive data.\n\n### DSAR Intake and Fulfillment Timelines\n- GDPR: Respond to access, correction, and deletion requests without undue delay and within 30 calendar days of receipt; a single extension up to 60 additional days is allowed when justified by complexity, with notification to the requester within the original 30 days.\n- CCPA/CPRA: Respond to access and deletion requests within 45 days; a 45-day extension is allowed when reasonably necessary with notice to the consumer.\n\n### Packaging of Responses\n- Access responses must include a human-readable summary and a machine-readable portable format commonly used in the industry, limited to the requestor’s personal data and clearly excluding other users’ data.\n\n### Deletion Scope and Exceptions\n- Deletion removes personal data that is not required for legal, security, or integrity obligations. Content removals may leave a publicly visible tombstone where necessary to preserve discussion coherence without revealing personal data.\n\n### Portability, Restriction, and Opt-Outs\n- Portability: Provide a structured, commonly used, machine-readable export of personal data the user provided and, where applicable, data observed through their use of the service.\n- Restriction: Temporarily limit processing where legally required while preserving data integrity for the restriction period.\n- Opt-Outs: Honor user opt-outs of sale/share, targeted advertising, and profiling where required by law without degrading core functionality.\n\n### Non-Discrimination\n- Users exercising rights shall not be charged different prices or receive a different level or quality of goods or services unless permitted by law and disclosed.\n\n### Retention and Storage Limitation\n| Data Type | Default Retention | Extensions and Holds | Final Disposition |\n|----------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Account Data | Lifetime of account + 30 days after deletion | Extended for legal holds | Permanent deletion |\n| Content Data | Lifetime of content; user-initiated deletion immediate | Retained in backups per backup window | Removal from active service; anonymized references where necessary |\n| Security Logs | 12 months | Extended for investigations/legal holds | Secure deletion |\n| Moderation Records | 24 months | Extended through appeal window and legal holds | Secure deletion or anonymization |\n| Incident Records | 5 years | As required by regulation | Secure deletion |\n| Backups | Up to 30 days | No extension absent legal holds | Rolling overwrite |\n\n### EARS Requirements — User Rights\n- WHEN a user submits a verified access request, THE civicDebateBoard SHALL provide a complete copy of the user’s personal data within the applicable legal timeframe and SHALL log the fulfillment event for audit.\n- WHEN a user submits a verified correction request, THE civicDebateBoard SHALL update inaccurate personal data within 30 days and SHALL notify the user upon completion.\n- WHEN a user submits a verified deletion request, THE civicDebateBoard SHALL delete personal data not required for legal or security obligations within 30 days and SHALL document exceptions with reasons.\n- IF identity verification for a rights request fails, THEN THE civicDebateBoard SHALL reject the request and SHALL provide a reason and a path to re-verify without revealing sensitive information.\n- WHERE the law permits timeline extensions, THE civicDebateBoard SHALL notify the requester of the extension and the justification before the original deadline expires.\n- WHILE a legal hold is active, THE civicDebateBoard SHALL suspend deletion for data subject to the hold and SHALL resume deletion once the hold is lifted.\n- WHEN a portability request is verified, THE civicDebateBoard SHALL provide a structured, commonly used, machine-readable export within legal timelines.\n- WHEN a restriction request is verified, THE civicDebateBoard SHALL mark affected data as restricted and SHALL prevent processing except for storage and legal obligations for the restriction duration.\n- WHEN a user opts out of targeted advertising or sale/share, THE civicDebateBoard SHALL cease such processing within 15 days and SHALL confirm the opt-out state to the user.\n\n### DSAR Lifecycle (Business Flow)\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Receive DSAR(Request Type)\"] --> B[\"Verify Identity(Reasonable Method)\"]\n  B --> C{\"Verified?\"}\n  C -->|\"No\"| D[\"Deny & Provide Re-verify Path\"]\n  C -->|\"Yes\"| E[\"Locate Data & Assess Scope\"]\n  E --> F{\"Extension Needed?\"}\n  F -->|\"Yes\"| G[\"Notify Extension & Justification\"]\n  F -->|\"No\"| H[\"Prepare Response(Package Type)\"]\n  G --> H\n  H --> I[\"Deliver Response & Log Audit\"]\n```\n\n## Security Expectations (Access Control, Data Protection in Business Terms)\nSecurity requirements are expressed as business obligations that protect users and the integrity of discourse while respecting role-based access.\n\n### Role-Based Access Expectations\n| Data/Action | member | verifiedMember | factChecker | moderator | admin |\n|------------|--------|----------------|------------|----------|-------|\n| View own Account Data | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Edit own Account Data | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| View other users’ Account Data | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Limited to enforcement need | Limited to administrative need |\n| Access Content Data (public) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Access flagged Moderation Data | ❌ | ❌ | Propose annotations only | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Issue sanctions | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Manage roles and platform policies | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |\n\nNote: Detailed role semantics are defined in [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./03-user-roles-and-authentication.md).
