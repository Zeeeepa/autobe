testability.\n\nContent creation and management:\n- THE service SHALL allow members to create, edit, and delete their own posts and comments within policy-compliant boundaries.\n- WHEN a user publishes content, THE service SHALL record topic tags, sources (if provided), and attribution for later policy checks and discovery.\n- WHERE the user is an expert, THE service SHALL enable long-form analyses and expert Q&A threads with expert badges.\n- IF content is reported, THEN THE service SHALL route it to the moderation queue and apply configured timelines for action.\n- WHILE content is under review, THE service SHALL optionally restrict visibility according to policy.\n\nDiscovery and curation:\n- THE service SHALL provide topic follow, expert follow, and curated features to surface relevant content.\n- WHEN users follow topics or experts, THE service SHALL generate personalized feeds and digests subject to user preferences.\n- WHERE editors curate features, THE service SHALL support announcements, pinned posts, and special packages.\n\nReactions and community signals:\n- THE service SHALL support reactions, voting, and bookmarking to quantify engagement and relevance.\n- WHEN a user reacts or votes, THE service SHALL update engagement signals used for ranking and curation.\n- IF abnormal engagement patterns are detected, THEN THE service SHALL flag items for review (anti-gaming).\n\nReporting and governance:\n- THE service SHALL provide a report feature with clear categories (e.g., misinformation, harassment, spam, off-topic).\n- WHEN reports are submitted, THE service SHALL acknowledge receipt and communicate outcomes per policy.\n- WHERE sanctions are applied, THE service SHALL log the action to a transparency record with reason codes.\n\nNotifications (business-level):\n- WHEN followed experts or topics publish, THE service SHALL notify followers subject to frequency limits and user consent.\n- IF the system detects notification fatigue, THEN THE service SHALL throttle non-critical notifications.\n\nRole-based capabilities (high level):\n- WHERE the user is a moderator, THE service SHALL provide tools to hide/remove content, warn, and request suspensions per policy.\n- WHERE the user is an editor, THE service SHALL manage tags/topics, featured lists, and announcements.\n- WHERE the user is an admin, THE service SHALL manage roles, policies, and compliance workflows.\n\nPerformance experience (business expectation):\n- WHEN users perform common actions (login, open feed, view post), THE service SHALL respond within a user-perceived 1–2 seconds for typical conditions.\n- WHERE complex searches and filters are executed, THE service SHALL return initial results within 3 seconds for common queries.\n\n## Scope and Out of Scope\nIn scope (business outcomes):\n- Account registration, login/logout, email verification, password reset.\n- Role-based permissions: member, expert, moderator, editor, admin.\n- Posts, comments, replies, mentions, reactions, votes, bookmarks.\n- Topic/tag management, topic/expert follow, curated features.\n- Reporting, moderation workflow, sanctions policy, transparency logs.\n-

The model blends four revenue pillars—contextual Ads, ethical Sponsorships, Premium Memberships, and aggregated Data & Insight Reports—operated under transparent governance to sustain credibility. Growth is driven by an expert-led content engine, curated discovery, visible moderation, and institutional partnerships. The operating model favors lean fixed costs with scalable variable spend, codified SLAs for content quality, sponsorship disclosure, and compliance.\n\nThis document provides business requirements only. All technical implementation decisions belong to the development team; it defines WHAT the system should do, not HOW to build it.\n\n## Why This Service Should Exist (Market Gap & Pain Points)\n- Information noise and polarization reduce the value of political/economic discussions; users lack credible, verifiable expert insights and clear norms.\n- General forums underinvest in moderation, driving low trust, toxicity, and regulatory risk for operators and advertisers.\n- Media outlets publish one-to-many;

Describes WHAT must happen in business terms; technical implementation decisions (architecture, APIs, database design, libraries, infrastructure) remain with the development team.\n\n## Authentication Requirements Overview\n- THE system SHALL support the full account lifecycle: registration, email verification, login, logout, password change, password reset, and session/device management.\n- THE system SHALL enforce role-based authorization for roles: guest (unauthenticated), member, expert, moderator, editor, admin.\n- THE system SHALL use JWT for access control with short-lived access tokens and longer-lived refresh tokens.\n- THE system SHALL record key authentication and authorization events for audit and security monitoring.\n- THE system SHALL operate default business time references in Asia/Seoul (KST) while respecting user-preferred locales for communications.\n\n## Account Lifecycle: Registration, Email Verification, Login, Logout, Password Reset/Change\n\n### Registration\n- WHEN a user attempts to register with email and password, THE system SHALL validate inputs against password policy and email format rules.\n- WHEN registration succeeds, THE system SHALL place the account in \"pending_verification\" state and require email ownership confirmation before enabling content interactions.\n- WHERE invitation-based or role elevation flows are used (e.g., expert candidates), THE system SHALL create the account as member and perform elevation post-verification and review.\n\nInput validation (business rules)\n- THE system SHALL require email in valid format containing a single \"@\", domain with at least one dot, and a TLD of 2–24 letters.\n- THE system SHALL reject disposable or blocked domains per policy-maintained lists.\n- THE system SHALL require password length ≥ 10 and at least 2 of the following classes: uppercase, lowercase, number, symbol; alternatively, passphrases ≥ 16 characters MAY include spaces with no additional class requirements.\n- THE system SHALL reject passwords present in the common-passwords list and those derived from the user’s personal identifiers (email local part, display name) with trivial mutations.\n\n### Email Verification\n- WHEN a registration is submitted, THE system SHALL send a verification message containing a single-use token.\n- THE system SHALL set verification tokens to expire in 30 minutes and be one-time use.\n- WHILE an account is unverified, THE system SHALL permit read-only public access and profile completion while blocking posting, commenting, voting, reporting, following, and reporting.\n- IF a verification token is expired or invalid, THEN THE system SHALL present a clear error and SHALL allow requesting a new token up to 3 times per 24 hours.\n- WHEN an email address is changed on an existing account, THE system SHALL re-verify ownership of the new address and restrict sensitive actions until verification completes.\n\n### Login\n- WHEN a user submits email and password, THE system SHALL validate credentials and respond within 2 seconds at P95 under normal load.\n- IF credentials are valid and the account is in good standing, THEN THE system SHALL create a session and issue access and refresh tokens embedding role and permissions.\n- IF the account is suspended, THEN THE system SHALL deny login and present the suspension reason and remaining duration where policy allows disclosure.\n- WHERE multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled by policy or user preference, THE system SHALL require a second factor (e.g., code or approved action) before issuing tokens.\n- WHEN a user opts for \"remember this device\" within policy, THE system SHALL mark the device session as trusted and reduce MFA prompts for 30 days unless risk signals require step-up authentication.\n\n### Logout\n- WHEN a user initiates logout, THE system SHALL invalidate the active access token and detach it from the corresponding refresh token chain for that device within 60 seconds.\n- WHEN the user selects \"log out from all devices\", THE system SHALL revoke all active sessions and refresh tokens associated with the account within 60 seconds.\n\n### Password Reset and Change\n- WHEN a user requests password reset, THE system SHALL send a one-time reset token that expires in 30 minutes and is invalidated upon use.\n- WHEN a user completes password reset, THE system SHALL invalidate all existing sessions and refresh tokens and require login with the new password.\n- WHEN a user changes password from a logged-in state, THE system SHALL prompt for current password re-authentication and SHALL invalidate all refresh tokens while allowing the current access token to expire on schedule unless policy requires immediate revocation.\n- WHERE password reset attempts exceed policy thresholds, THE system SHALL apply rate limits and communicate the next eligible time.\n\n## Account States and Transitions\nStates: pending_verification, active, suspended_temporary, suspended_permanent, disabled_security, deleted_pending, deleted_final.\n\n- THE system SHALL maintain a canonical account state and update it atomically.\n- WHEN email verification completes successfully, THE system SHALL transition state from pending_verification to active immediately.\n- WHEN a temporary suspension is applied, THE system SHALL set state to suspended_temporary with an end timestamp and block new sessions until expiry or lift.\n- WHEN a permanent suspension is applied, THE system SHALL set state to suspended_permanent and block all sessions indefinitely unless reversed by admin.\n- WHEN a security incident necessitates protection, THE system SHALL set state to disabled_security and require remediation (e.g., password reset, step-up verification) prior to reactivation.\n- WHEN an account deletion request is confirmed after cooling-off, THE system SHALL transition to deleted_final and block authentication permanently.\n- IF a suspension period expires, THEN THE system SHALL switch the account back to active and restore login capability.\n- WHILE an appeal is pending under governance policy, THE system SHALL preserve the current enforcement state until the appeal outcome.\n\n## Session and Token Management (JWT) Principles\n- THE system SHALL issue JWT access tokens with a lifetime of 20 minutes and refresh tokens with a lifetime of 14 days.\n- THE system SHALL rotate refresh tokens on every use and SHALL invalidate the previous token immediately after rotation.\n- THE system SHALL detect refresh token reuse and SHALL revoke the entire refresh token family upon detection, requiring re-authentication.\n- THE system SHALL embed in JWT payload at minimum: userId, role, a permissions array, issued-at time, expiration time; optional claims MAY include trust level, verified status, and badges when relevant to business logic.\n- WHERE audience, issuer, and token purpose distinctions are required for business control, THE system SHALL include business-identifying claims sufficient for environment isolation and contract-level enforcement.\n- IF a user’s role or permissions change, THEN THE system SHALL invalidate all active refresh tokens within 60 seconds and require token re-issuance under the new role.\n- WHERE device-level session tracking is enabled, THE system SHALL allow users to view active device sessions (device label, approximate location, last activity) and revoke individual sessions.\n- IF suspicious activity is detected on a session (impossible travel, abnormal IP/device velocity per policy), THEN THE system SHALL flag the session and require step-up verification prior to continued access.\n- WHERE client storage policy applies, THE system SHALL support secure storage of tokens with preference for httpOnly cookies; localStorage MAY be used where acceptable by policy. Developers retain discretion on exact mechanism.\n- THE system SHALL maintain a business-level key rotation policy for the JWT signing keys, including dual-publish windows, scheduled rotations at least every 180 days, and emergency rotation capability within 24 hours of incident declaration.\n- WHERE session concurrency policy applies, THE system SHALL limit simultaneous active device sessions per user to 10 by default (admin-configurable) and SHALL deny creation of additional sessions beyond the limit with guidance to revoke existing sessions.\n\n## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Policy (Business Level)\n- WHERE MFA is mandated by policy or user opt-in, THE system SHALL support at least one possession factor and SHALL allow recovery paths that balance security and usability.\n- WHEN a sensitive action occurs (password change, email change, role elevation, global sign-out), THE system SHALL require step-up verification if MFA is enabled or risk signals are present.\n- IF repeated high-risk signals are detected within 24 hours (e.g., 3+ impossible-travel detections), THEN THE system SHALL enforce MFA on next login even for trusted devices.\n\n## Role Definitions and Permission Descriptions\nJWT payloads MUST include role and a permissions array reflecting granted actions.

Attempt Limits, Account Suspension/Unlock, Device Logout, MFA\n\n### Password Rules\n- THE system SHALL enforce minimum password length of 10 and the defined complexity rules.\n- THE system SHALL permit passphrases ≥ 16 characters without additional complexity requirements.\n- IF a password is found in a banned list or derived from personal identifiers, THEN THE system SHALL reject it with guidance to choose a stronger password.\n- WHEN a password is changed or reset, THE system SHALL require re-authentication for sensitive actions for the next 5 minutes.\n\n### Login Attempt Limits and Abuse Prevention\n- THE system SHALL allow up to 5 failed login attempts per account per rolling 15 minutes before temporary lockout.\n- IF the threshold is exceeded, THEN THE system SHALL lock the account for 15 minutes and SHALL send an advisory notice to the account email.\n- WHERE suspicious velocity or credential stuffing is detected, THE system SHALL apply adaptive throttling and MAY require additional verification.\n- THE system SHALL reset failure counters upon successful login.\n\n### Account Suspension and Unlock\n- WHEN a moderator submits a suspension request with reason codes and proposed duration, THE system SHALL route it for admin execution and log the decision.\n- WHEN an admin executes a suspension, THE system SHALL immediately revoke all sessions and block new sessions until the suspension ends or is lifted.\n- IF the suspension period expires, THEN THE system SHALL automatically restore login capability and flag the account for post-suspension review where policy requires.\n- WHERE an appeal is in progress per governance policy, THE system SHALL maintain the current enforcement state until the appeal outcome.\n\n### Device Logout and Session Visibility\n- THE system SHALL provide users a list of active sessions including device label, approximate location (city/country), and last activity timestamp.\n- WHEN a user revokes a specific session, THE system SHALL invalidate the corresponding refresh token and any derived access tokens within 60 seconds.\n- WHEN a user selects \"log out from all devices\", THE system SHALL revoke all active sessions and refresh tokens within 60 seconds and confirm completion.\n\n### MFA Application Rules\n- THE system SHALL provide MFA enrollment and backup/recovery options (e.g., backup codes) with rate-limited retrieval.\n- WHEN MFA is enabled, THE system SHALL require step-up verification for high-risk actions (password/email change, role elevation, global sign-out, viewing audit logs where role permits).\n\n## Error Handling and Recovery (Auth-Specific)\n- IF login fails due to invalid credentials, THEN THE system SHALL present a generic failure message without disclosing whether the email exists.\n- IF login fails due to unverified email, THEN THE system SHALL allow immediate resend of verification up to the daily resend limit.\n- IF login is blocked due to account suspension, THEN THE system SHALL present suspension status and policy-based guidance.\n- IF a password reset token is invalid or expired, THEN THE system SHALL explain the issue and allow requesting a new token subject to rate limits.\n- IF token refresh fails due to reuse or rotation violation, THEN THE system SHALL revoke the refresh token family and require re-authentication.\n- WHEN system-side anomalies affect authentication, THE system SHALL provide status messaging and reference codes for support without exposing internals.\n\n## Performance and Rate-Limiting Expectations\n- THE system SHALL complete credential validation and token issuance within 2 seconds at P95 under normal load.\n- THE system SHALL deliver verification and reset emails within 60 seconds at P95 under normal load.\n- THE system SHALL support at least 10 token refreshes per user per hour without degradation, subject to normal rate-limits.\n- WHERE global traffic protection is necessary, THE system SHALL enforce per-IP and per-account rate limits for registration, login, verification, and reset actions per policy thresholds.\n\n## Audit and Security Considerations (Business Perspective)\n- THE system SHALL maintain audit records for registration, verification, login success/failure, logout, token refresh, token revocation, password change/reset, role/permission change, suspension requests and executions, MFA enrollment/usage, and device trust changes.\n- THE system SHALL ensure audit records include: actor (userId or system), action, timestamp, business context (e.g., device label, approximate location), and outcome (success/failure).\n- THE system SHALL align event retention with the data lifecycle policy and ensure data minimization and pseudonymization where feasible.\n- THE system SHALL enable authorized reviewers (admin; limited moderator scope) to access relevant audit views while honoring least privilege.\n- IF anomalous authentication patterns are detected, THEN THE system SHALL generate security alerts for review and MAY trigger protective measures (step-up authentication, temporary locks).\n- THE system SHALL support JWT signing key rotation according to policy with auditable activation timestamps and approver roles.\n\n## Mermaid Diagram: Authentication and Token Flow\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"User Authentication Flow\"\n    A[\"Start(Login)\"]

Log\"]\n  end\n```\n\n## EARS-Formatted Detailed Requirements\n\n### Ubiquitous Requirements\n- THE authentication service SHALL require email verification before enabling content creation or interaction actions.\n- THE authorization service SHALL enforce role-based permissions as defined in the Permission Matrix.\n- THE token service SHALL issue access tokens with 20-minute lifetime and refresh tokens with 14-day lifetime.\n- THE security service SHALL maintain audit logs for all authentication and authorization events listed in this file.\n- THE risk service SHALL evaluate session signals and require step-up verification under suspicious conditions.\n\n### Event-Driven Requirements\n- WHEN a user registers, THE system SHALL send a verification message containing a single-use token that expires in 30 minutes.\n- WHEN a user logs in successfully, THE system SHALL bind the session to a device identifier and record last activity time.\n- WHEN a user logs out, THE system SHALL invalidate the active session within 60 seconds.\n- WHEN a refresh token is presented, THE system SHALL rotate it and invalidate the prior token.\n- WHEN a role is elevated (e.g., member → expert), THE system SHALL revoke existing refresh tokens and require re-authentication.\n- WHEN a moderator submits a sanction request, THE system SHALL route it for admin decision and log the outcome.\n- WHEN a user changes email address, THE system SHALL require verification of the new address before enabling sensitive actions.\n- WHEN a user enables MFA, THE system SHALL prompt for a second factor during login and sensitive actions.\n\n### State-Driven Requirements\n- WHILE an account remains unverified, THE system SHALL restrict the account to read-only public access and profile completion.\n- WHILE an account is under active suspension, THE system SHALL block login and token issuance.\n- WHILE an appeal is pending per governance policy, THE system SHALL preserve the current enforcement state.\n- WHILE a device session is marked trusted, THE system SHALL suppress MFA prompts unless risk signals are present.\n\n### Unwanted Behavior Requirements\n- IF a login attempt fails, THEN THE system SHALL present a generic error without confirming account existence.\n- IF failed login attempts exceed 5 within 15 minutes, THEN THE system SHALL lock the account for 15 minutes and log the event.\n- IF a refresh token reuse is detected, THEN THE system SHALL revoke the entire token family and require re-authentication.\n- IF impossible travel or anomalous activity is detected, THEN THE system SHALL require step-up verification before issuing tokens.\n- IF a password reset token is expired or invalid, THEN THE system SHALL deny the reset and allow a new request within policy limits.\n- IF session concurrency exceeds the allowed limit, THEN THE system SHALL deny additional session creation and advise revocation of older sessions.\n\n### Optional Features Requirements\n- WHERE multi-factor authentication is enabled, THE system SHALL require a second factor during login and sensitive actions.\n- WHERE device session visibility is enabled, THE system SHALL display active sessions and allow revocation by the user.\n- WHERE organization policy mandates httpOnly cookies, THE system SHALL store tokens in secure cookies rather than other storage options.\n- WHERE trusted device preference is enabled, THE system SHALL reduce MFA prompts for trusted sessions for up to 30 days.\n\n## Business Rules and Validation Details\n- Email format: must include \"@\" and a domain containing at least one dot; TLD length 2–24; reject blocked domains.\n- Password: minimum length 10; at least 2 character classes unless passphrase ≥ 16; reject common and personal-info-based passwords.\n- Display names: prohibited from impersonating public figures or organizations per governance policy.\n- Verification/resets: tokens are single-use, expire in 30 minutes, and are rate-limited to 3 sends per 24 hours per account.\n- Sensitive changes (email, password): require re-authentication within the past 5 minutes.\n\n## Success Criteria and KPIs (Auth Scope)\n- Email verification completion rate ≥ 90% within 24 hours of registration under normal operations.\n- Login response time ≤ 2 seconds at P95 under normal load.\n- Password reset email delivery ≤ 60 seconds at P95.\n- Security alert false-positive rate ≤ 5% after tuning.\n- Token reuse detection time ≤ 5 seconds from event to enforcement.\n\n## Dependencies and References\n- Community sanctions, appeals,

Content focuses on WHAT the system must do and excludes architecture, API shapes, database schemas, and infrastructure details. Developers retain full autonomy over technical implementation.\n\nAlign authentication, authorization, and roles with the [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./03-pol-econ-board-user-roles-and-authentication.md). Refer to flows in the [User Flows and Process Diagrams](./06-pol-econ-board-user-flows.md). Apply governance and sanctions from the [Community Governance and Moderation Requirements](./07-pol-econ-board-community-governance-and-moderation.md). Connect business events to delivery rules in the [Notifications and Communications Requirements](./11-pol-econ-board-notifications-and-communications.md).\n\n## 1) Purpose and Scope\n- Define the full set of functional capabilities required for a moderated, expertise-forward political and economic discussion platform.\n- Establish business rules, input validation, processing logic, outputs, performance expectations, error handling, and role-based constraints.\n- Cover member-generated content, expert contributions, editorial curation, moderation workflows, personalization, search, subscriptions, and notification triggers.\n\n## 2) Terminology and Global Conventions\n- Timezone: Business time windows and SLAs use Asia/Seoul (KST). User-facing times SHALL respect the user’s configured local timezone where preferences exist.\n- Counting windows: Unless stated otherwise, rate limits use rolling 60-minute windows for per-hour metrics and rolling 24-hour windows for daily metrics.\n- Content policy baseline: Content behaviors defer to the [Community Governance and Moderation Requirements](./07-pol-econ-board-community-governance-and-moderation.md).\n- Performance baseline: Unless specified, simple actions (create/edit/delete/like/bookmark/follow) SHALL complete within 2 seconds for the user; discovery actions (search/filter/sort) SHALL respond within 1 second for common queries and within 3 seconds for complex queries under typical load.\n- Content states: Draft (private to author and reviewers where applicable); Published (visible per visibility rules); Hidden (system- or moderator-suppressed); Soft-Hidden (limited visibility, e.g., author and direct participants only); Archived (excluded from default feeds but still accessible as defined herein).\n- Versioning: Each published edit creates an immutable version that can be viewed in comparisons.\n- Visibility levels (business): Public; Limited (followers or invited audiences where configured); Staff-only (moderators/editors/admins).\n\n## 3) Role Context (Business Perspective)\n- member: Create and manage own posts and comments; react, follow, bookmark, report, and block; subject to rate limits and policy.\n- expert: All member privileges plus expert badge, expert-only topic proposals, long-form research/insight posts, expert Q&A participation, expert recommendation signals.\n- moderator: Review reports, hide/delete content per policy, request sanctions, manage disputes, maintain transparency logs.\n- editor: Curate categories and tags, manage featured content, announcements, and pins; collaborate with moderators on policy issues.\n- admin: Oversight of roles, policies, legal requests, and service health.\n\nRole-based constraints per feature are embedded in the sections below. The full role model and JWT principles reside in the [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./03-pol-econ-board-user-roles-and-authentication.md).\n\n---\n\n## 4) Functional Requirements (EARS)\n\n### 4.1) Post Management (Create/Edit/Delete/Version)\nBusiness fields (business-level, not schema):\n- Title (4–120 characters)\n- Body (≥ 20 characters for published posts; drafts may be shorter but must be non-empty)\n- Attachments (0–10 files; each ≤ 25 MB; types: image, PDF, CSV; videos only when explicitly enabled)\n- Category (exactly one controlled value)\n- Tags (0–5; profanity/ban list filtered; each 1–30 characters)\n- Visibility (public/limited/staff-only)\n- Source links (0–10; valid URLs)\n- Content warnings (0–3 from predefined list)\n- Estimated reading time (auto-calculated)\n- Language (e.g., Korean, English)\n\nValidation and creation\n- WHEN a user submits a new post as draft, THE system SHALL validate title length 4–120 characters, body length ≥ 1 character for drafts and ≥ 20 characters for publication, and allowed attachment count/size/types.\n- WHEN a user saves a draft, THE system SHALL persist within 2 seconds and return the draft identifier and last-saved timestamp.\n- WHEN a user attempts to publish, THE system SHALL require Category and enforce at least one source link for “analysis/research” post types.\n- WHERE the user role is member, THE system SHALL allow publishing up to 10 posts per 24 hours.\n- WHERE the user role is expert, THE system SHALL allow publishing up to 20 posts per 24 hours and permit “long-form” flag up to 20,000 characters body.\n- WHERE the user role is moderator or editor, THE system SHALL allow staff-only posts without public visibility for operational notices.\n\nEditing and versioning\n- WHEN an author edits a published post, THE system SHALL create a new immutable version and retain prior versions for comparison.\n- WHERE edits occur within 10 minutes of publication, THE system SHALL allow “silent update” without feed bump; after 10 minutes, feed bump SHALL occur unless staff marks “no-bump”.\n- WHILE a post is draft, THE system SHALL allow unlimited edits and autosave at least every 30 seconds of active typing.\n\nDeletion and restoration\n- WHEN an author deletes own post, THE system SHALL soft-delete and hide from public while retaining for 30 days for potential restoration.\n- IF a soft-deleted post is restored within 30 days, THEN THE system SHALL reinstate its visibility and maintain version history continuity.\n- IF a post is under active investigation (flagged), THEN THE system SHALL prevent author deletion until moderation completes or staff override is recorded.\n\nIntegrity and policy checks\n- WHEN a post contains more than 3 external links, THE system SHALL flag it for automated spam review without blocking publication unless thresholds are exceeded (see §4.7).\n- WHERE content includes media attachments, THE system SHALL require a text alternative (caption/alt-text) per accessibility requirements (§4.13).\n- IF a post violates rate limits or is under sanction, THEN THE system SHALL deny publishing with a clear reason and next eligible time.\n\nOutputs\n- THE system SHALL return identifiers, timestamps (created/updated/published), current visibility, version number, moderation status, and derived signals (e.g., estimated reading time) upon create/edit/publish.\n\nPerformance\n- THE post save or publish operation SHALL complete within 2 seconds under nominal load for text-only posts; within 5 seconds when up to 10 attachments are included.\n\nEdge constraints\n- WHERE mentions in the post body exceed 20 unique users, THE system SHALL block publication and instruct the author to reduce mass-mentions per anti-abuse policy.\n- WHERE tags include banned terms, THE system SHALL reject publication with a policy-aligned reason code.\n\n### 4.2) Comments, Replies, Mentions\nScope\n- Comments support one level of replies (reply-to-comment). Mentions use “@handle” of users with public mentionability.\n\nValidation and creation\n- WHEN a user submits a comment, THE system SHALL validate length 1–5,000 characters and disallow empty or media-only comments.\n- WHERE the role is member or expert, THE system SHALL allow up to 60 comments per 24 hours.\n- WHEN a reply is created, THE system SHALL associate it with the parent comment and the post thread.\n- WHEN a user mentions another user, THE system SHALL validate mention permissions and block interactions with users who are blocked by or have blocked the author.\n- WHERE a single comment attempts to mention more than 10 distinct users, THE system SHALL block submission and return a mass-mention limit message.\n\nEditing and deletion\n- WHERE the author is the comment owner, THE system SHALL allow edits for 15 minutes with an edit marker displayed thereafter.\n- WHEN the author deletes a comment, THE system SHALL soft-delete and replace with a placeholder indicating removal.\n\nAbuse and policy\n- IF a comment triggers prohibited content rules, THEN THE system SHALL route it to moderation queues and may auto-hide according to §4.7 thresholds.\n\nNotifications\n- WHEN a user is mentioned, THE system SHALL enqueue a mention notification per preferences (§4.11).\n\nOutputs and performance\n- THE system SHALL return identifiers, parent linkage, timestamps, mention list, and moderation status for created comments.\n- THE comment create/edit/delete operation SHALL complete within 1 second for text-only content.\n\n### 4.3) Categories, Tags, Topic Follow\nCategories and tags\n- WHEN a post is published, THE system SHALL require exactly one Category from the controlled list managed by editors.\n- WHERE tags are provided, THE system SHALL allow up to 5 free-form tags validated against profanity/ban lists and length 1–30 characters.\n- WHEN editors modify category definitions, THE system SHALL preserve historical category labels on existing posts while applying new taxonomy prospectively.\n\nTopic follow\n- WHEN a user follows a topic (category/tag or editor-curated topic), THE system SHALL add it to the user’s subscription list.\n- WHERE a user follows a topic, THE system SHALL prioritize that topic in personalized feeds (§4.10).\n- IF a followed topic is deprecated, THEN THE system SHALL notify followers and suggest alternatives; migrations SHALL preserve user preferences with user-confirmable mapping.\n\n### 4.4) Votes, Reactions, Recommendations\nVote and reaction types\n- Votes support “Agree” and “Disagree”. Reactions support “Insightful”, “Question”, “Source requested”, and “Appreciation”.\n\nConstraints\n- WHERE a user is authenticated, THE system SHALL allow one vote per post per user with ability to change the choice; reactions are one per type per user per post.\n- WHERE the actor is expert, THE system SHALL allow an “Expert Recommend” marker distinct from general reactions.\n- IF a post is archived or hidden, THEN THE system SHALL block new votes/reactions while preserving counts.\n\nOutputs and display rules (business)\n- WHEN counts are requested for display, THE system SHALL provide

load.\n\nPerformance\n- THE system SHALL record a vote or reaction within 1 second and reflect updated counts within 2 seconds in dependent views.\n\nAnti-abuse\n- WHERE a single account submits >10 reactions within 10 seconds, THE system SHALL delay further reactions for 30 seconds (§4.12).\n\n### 4.5) Bookmarks, Read State, Saved Items\n- WHEN a user bookmarks a post, THE system SHALL store it in the user’s bookmarks and allow foldering into up to 20 named collections (collection name 1–40 characters, profanity filtered).\n- WHILE a user scrolls through a post, THE system SHALL track read progress and mark as “read” when ≥ 80% of body is viewed or ≥ 10 seconds of engaged reading elapse, whichever comes later.\n- WHEN a user saves a post for offline reading (business concept), THE system SHALL store a snapshot of the text and metadata for later retrieval; media may be excluded depending on rights.\n- WHERE the user requests export of saved items, THE system SHALL prepare an export within 10 seconds for up to 100 items and provide a durable link or retrieval reference.\n- IF a bookmarked item is deleted or becomes private, THEN THE system SHALL retain a placeholder with permissible metadata and indicate unavailability.\n\n### 4.6) Search, Sort, Filter\nInputs and validation\n- WHEN a user searches, THE system SHALL accept queries up to 200 characters, with logical operators AND/OR and quoted phrases.\n- WHERE filters are applied, THE system SHALL support Category, Tags, Author, Role (expert only), Date range, Content type (post/comment), Minimum reaction score,

summaries/visibility state as appropriate).\n\nPerformance\n- THE system SHALL return common query results within 1 second and complex multi-filter queries within 3 seconds under typical load.\n\nSafety and integrity\n- IF a query triggers sensitive or election-period rules, THEN THE system SHALL elevate checks per governance policy and annotate affected results with compliance labels where applicable.\n\n### 4.7) Reporting, Blocking, and Automation Rules\nReporting\n- WHEN a user reports content, THE system SHALL require a reason category (e.g., Misinformation, Harassment, Hate, Spam, Off-topic, Illegal) and an optional note up to 500 characters.\n- WHERE a single content item receives ≥ 5 reports within 1 hour, THE system SHALL flag it for expedited review.\n\nAuto-hide thresholds\n- WHERE reports ≥ 20 from distinct users within 3 hours OR a weighted score threshold is exceeded (expert reports count as 2), THE system SHALL auto-hide the content pending review.\n- IF auto-hide is triggered, THEN THE system SHALL notify the author and provide an appeal link to the dispute workflow.\n\nBlocking\n- WHEN a user blocks another user, THE system SHALL hide the blocker’s view of the blockee’s content and prevent mentions and direct interactions between them.\n- WHILE a block is active, THE system SHALL suppress notifications originating from the blocked user to the blocker.\n\nStaff workflows\n- WHEN content is auto-hidden or reported beyond thresholds, THE system SHALL place it into the moderation queue with metadata: report counts by category, timestamps, involved users, and preliminary risk assessment.\n\nRate-limits on reporting\n- WHERE the user files reports, THE system SHALL limit to 30 reports per 24 hours.\n\n### 4.8) Draft, Review, Publish Workflow\nStates\n- Draft → Submitted for Review (optional) → Published → Updated (versioned) → Archived/Hidden.\n\nRules\n- WHERE the author is expert and the post is marked as “long-form research”, THE system SHALL require either editor review or source completeness check before publication.\n- WHERE the post includes a “content warning”, THE system SHALL display a preface and require user confirmation before viewing full content.\n- WHEN an editor rejects a submission, THE system SHALL return reasons and allow resubmission after corrections.\n- WHEN a post is archived, THE system SHALL remove it from feeds while retaining searchability for staff and author.\n\nSLA\n- WHERE review is required, THE system SHALL complete first review within 24 hours under normal operations.\n\n### 4.9) Announcements, Pinned Posts, Special Curation\n- WHERE the actor is editor or admin, THE system SHALL allow creating “Announcement” posts visible to all users.\n- WHEN a post is pinned in a section by an editor, THE system SHALL keep it at the top of that section for a configurable duration (1–14 days).\n- WHERE a post is featured in a curated collection, THE system SHALL annotate it with the collection label and ensure it appears in that collection’s feed.\n- IF a pinned item expires, THEN THE system SHALL unpin it automatically and record the unpin event in audit logs.\n- WHERE editorial quality requires temporary visibility reduction, THE system SHALL allow editors to apply non-policy-based soft-hiding with rationale visible to staff.\n\n### 4.10) Feeds, Timelines, Subscriptions\nPersonalization\n- WHERE a user follows topics or authors, THE system SHALL prioritize their content in the user’s home feed while ensuring at least 30% diversity from non-followed but relevant topics.\n- WHERE the actor is unauthenticated, THE system SHALL show a general feed based on overall quality and recency.\n\nOrdering and freshness\n- WHEN building feeds, THE system SHALL prefer recency within the past 72 hours and decay older items unless they are featured or actively discussed.\n- WHERE duplicate appearances would occur within the same feed page, THE system SHALL deduplicate items.\n\nIntegrity\n- IF a post is hidden or under sanction, THEN THE system SHALL exclude it from public feeds while staff views remain available.\n- WHERE a block or mute exists, THE

Users discover content, register, verify, and sign in; create and publish posts; engage via comments and reactions; and escalate issues through reporting. Experts produce in-depth analyses; moderators and editors ensure compliance and quality; admins manage global policies and escalations.\n\nKey journey highlights:\n- Onboarding: registration, email verification, sign-in, session maintenance, secure sign-out across devices.\n- Creation: draft → edit → version tracking → publish; optional pre-publish review based on policies and role capabilities.\n- Governance: report → triage → action (hide/delete/sanction) → transparency log → appeal → review → resolution.\n- Notifications: real-time and batch/digest messages that respect user preferences, quiet hours, and rate limits.\n\n### High-Level Journey Diagram\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Discover Content\"] --> B[\"Register/Sign In\"]\n  B --> C[\"Create Draft/Post\"]\n  C --> D{\"Publish?\"}\n  D -->|\"Yes\"| E[\"Visible Per Policy\"]\n  D -->|\"No\"| F[\"Save as Draft\"]\n  E --> G[\"Engage(Comments/Reactions)\"]\n  G --> H{\"Policy Violation Report?\"}\n  H -->|\"No\"| I[\"Continue Engagement\"]\n  H -->|\"Yes\"| J[\"Moderation Workflow\"]\n  J --> K{\"Action Required?\"}\n  K -->|\"Yes\"| L[\"Apply Action(Sanction/Hide/Delete)\"]\n  K -->|\"No\"| M[\"Close with No Action\"]\n  E --> N[\"Notifications\"]\n```\n\n## Account Creation and Authentication Flow\nCovers registration, email verification, sign-in, session maintenance, sign-out, password reset, and cross-device revocation. Token usage adheres to JWT-based principles defined in the authentication requirements.\n\n### Narrative Flow\n- Registration: A user submits registration data; inputs are validated; a pending-verification account is created; verification instructions are sent; account activates upon successful verification.\n- Sign-in: A user submits credentials; the system validates and establishes a session with short-lived access and longer-lived refresh tokens. Failed attempts increase a counter that can trigger temporary lockout.\n- Password reset: A user initiates a reset; a one-time, time-bound reset process is issued; after success, prior sessions are invalidated per policy.\n- Sign-out and device revocation: A user signs out on the current device and may revoke all sessions across all devices.\n\n### Role Notes\n- All roles use the same authentication and session flow; role assignment influences authorization decisions after sign-in.\n\n### EARS Requirements (Authentication)\n- THE authentication service SHALL accept registration with email and password and create an account in a pending-verification state.\n- WHEN a user completes email verification within the valid window, THE authentication service SHALL activate the account for sign-in.\n- IF email verification is attempted after expiration, THEN THE authentication service SHALL deny activation and allow requesting a new verification process.\n- WHEN a user submits valid credentials, THE authentication service SHALL establish a session and issue tokens with defined expirations.\n- IF a login attempt uses invalid credentials, THEN THE authentication service SHALL reject the login, increment a failure counter, and present a non-revealing error message.\n- WHERE the failure counter exceeds the lockout threshold within a window, THE authentication service SHALL apply a temporary login delay and provide guidance for password reset.\n- WHEN a user requests password reset, THE authentication service SHALL issue a one-time reset process bound to time and single-use constraints.\n- WHEN a password reset is completed, THE authentication service SHALL invalidate prior sessions according to security policy.\n- WHEN a user signs out, THE authentication service SHALL terminate the current session immediately.\n- WHEN a user requests device-wide sign-out, THE authentication service SHALL revoke all active sessions associated with the account.\n- WHILE a session is active, THE authentication service SHALL refresh access according to token refresh policy and deny refresh after refresh expiration.\n- THE authentication service SHALL respond to sign-in attempts within 2 seconds under normal load.\n\n### Account Creation & Authentication Diagram\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Registration\"\n    A[\"Start Registration\"] --> B[\"Validate Inputs\"]\n    B --> C{\"Valid?\"}\n    C -->|\"Yes\"| D[\"Create Pending Account\"]\n    C -->|\"No\"| E[\"Reject and Explain\"]\n    D --> F[\"Send Verification\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Verification\"\n    F --> G[\"User Follows Link\"]\n    G --> H{\"Within Valid Window?\"}\n    H -->|\"Yes\"| I[\"Activate Account\"]\n    H -->|\"No\"| J[\"Offer New Verification\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Sign-In & Session\"\n    K[\"Submit Credentials\"] --> L[\"Validate Credentials\"]\n    L --> M{\"Valid?\"}\n    M -->|\"Yes\"| N[\"Issue Tokens\"]\n    M -->|\"No\"| O[\"Reject and Increment Counter\"]\n    N --> P[\"Access Protected Resources\"]\n    P --> Q{\"Refresh Needed?\"}\n    Q -->|\"Yes\"| R[\"Refresh Within Policy\"]\n    Q -->|\"No\"| S[\"Continue\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Sign-Out & Revocation\"\n    T[\"User Sign-Out\"] --> U[\"Terminate Current Session\"]\n    V[\"Revoke All Devices\"] --> W[\"Invalidate All Sessions\"]\n  end\n```\n\n## Post Create, Edit, Publish Flow\nCovers drafting, editing, versioning, and publishing with policy checks and role-based nuances.\n\n### Narrative Flow\n- Drafting: Any authenticated member or expert creates drafts with autosave. Editors and admins typically do not author on behalf of others unless policy allows; editors manage curation and featured placement via separate processes.\n- Editing: Authors freely edit drafts; edits to published posts create versions with change logs. Members update their own content; experts publish “insight” or “research” posts under the same versioning rules.\n- Pre-publish checks: Policy validations run (e.g., restricted topics during sensitive periods, required sources for factual claims). Signals or rules may route posts for moderator review.\n- Publishing: If checks pass and no mandatory review applies, the post becomes visible per visibility policy (public or restricted). If review is required, visibility remains limited until approval.\n\n### Role Notes\n- member: drafts, edits, publishes own content; subject to automated checks and potential moderation review.\n- expert: same as member with expert labeling; does not bypass policy enforcement.\n- editor: features and pins posts; manages topics/labels; cannot unilaterally override policy enforcement.\n- moderator: may hold, hide, or request actions per governance policy.\n- admin: oversees legal/policy compliance and system-level settings.\n\n### EARS Requirements (Authoring & Publishing)\n- WHEN an authenticated user creates a draft, THE content service SHALL save the draft and maintain an immutable version history upon each significant save.\n- WHILE a post remains in draft, THE content service SHALL restrict visibility to the author and authorized reviewers where applicable.\n- WHEN an author attempts to publish, THE content service SHALL execute policy checks including restricted periods, mandatory citations, and prohibited content categories.\n- IF any mandatory check fails, THEN THE content service SHALL block publishing, present failure reasons, and preserve the draft state.\n- WHERE a post is flagged by automated heuristics or configured rules, THE content service SHALL route the post to a moderation queue and defer public visibility until decision.\n- WHEN a post passes all checks without mandatory review, THE content service SHALL publish the post and set visibility per policy immediately.\n- WHEN an author edits a published post, THE content service SHALL create a new version, preserve prior versions, and update the live version upon successful checks.\n- IF an author attempts to edit content under active investigation, THEN THE content service SHALL restrict edits to draft-copy only and prevent live changes until the investigation concludes.\n- THE content service SHALL record publication timestamps and version identifiers for transparency.\n- THE content service SHALL complete pre-publish validation within 3 seconds for standard-length posts under normal load.\n\n### Authoring & Publishing Diagram\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Drafting\"\n    A[\"Start Draft\"] --> B[\"Autosave Draft\"]\n    B --> C[\"Edit Content\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Pre-Publish Checks\"\n    C --> D[\"Run Policy Checks\"]\n    D --> E{\"Checks Pass?\"}\n    E -->|\"No\"| F[\"Block Publish and Explain\"]\n    E -->|\"Yes\"| G{\"Flagged for Review?\"}\n    G -->|\"Yes\"| H[\"Route to Moderation Queue\"]\n    G -->|\"No\"| I[\"Publish Immediately\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Post-Publish\"\n    I --> J[\"Visible per Policy\"]\n    H --> K{\"Moderator Decision\"}\n    K -->|\"Approve\"| L[\"Publish\"]\n    K -->|\"Reject\"| M[\"Return to Draft with Reasons\"]\n    K -->|\"Request Changes\"| N[\"Author Revises Draft\"]\n    N -.-> D\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Editing Published Content\"\n    O[\"Edit Published Post\"] --> P[\"Create New Version\"]\n    P --> D\n  end\n```\n\n## Report Intake → Moderation → Appeal Flow\nDefines how users report content, how moderators triage and act, and how authors can appeal decisions. Time expectations are stated in business terms.\n\n### Narrative Flow\n- Reporting: Any authenticated user reports content under specified categories (e.g., misinformation, hate, spam). The system validates report completeness and enters it into the moderation queue.\n- Triage: Moderators review by severity and context, consult guidelines, and record transparent decisions, including temporary hiding where warranted.\n- Actions: Outcomes include no action, warning, temporary suspension, edit request, hide, or delete. Sanctioning follows the governance policy and transparency logging.\n- Appeal: Affected users file appeals within a defined window. Appeals are reviewed by a different moderator or a designated reviewer. Decisions are logged and communicated.\n\n### Role Notes\n- member/expert: submit reports; appeal actions affecting their content or account.\n- moderator: triage reports; apply content actions; propose or apply sanctions within remit.\n- editor: collaborates on quality; does not override moderation outcomes unilaterally.\n- admin: handles escalations, legal requests, and final adjudication when policy demands.\n\n### EARS Requirements (Moderation)\n- WHEN a user submits a report with a valid category and target, THE governance service SHALL create a case and place it in the moderation queue.\n- IF the report lacks required details, THEN THE governance service SHALL reject the submission and instruct the reporter to provide missing fields.\n- WHERE content presents imminent harm indicators, THE governance service SHALL apply temporary hiding pending expedited review.\n- WHEN a moderator reviews a case, THE governance service SHALL require a decision record including category, rationale, and action.\n- WHEN a case is resolved with action, THE governance service SHALL notify the reporter and affected parties with outcome and rationale.\n- WHERE a sanction affects account capabilities, THE governance service SHALL enforce restrictions immediately upon decision.\n- WHEN an appeal is received within the allowed window, THE governance service SHALL assign it to an eligible reviewer distinct from the original decision maker.\n- IF an appeal is upheld, THEN THE governance service SHALL restore the content or reverse sanctions and update the transparency record.\n- IF an appeal is denied, THEN THE governance service SHALL maintain the action and record the rationale.\n- THE governance service SHALL target initial triage within 24 hours for standard cases and within 2 hours for imminent harm indicators.\n\n### Moderation & Appeal Diagram\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Report Intake\"\n    A[\"Submit Report\"] --> B[\"Validate Fields\"]\n    B --> C{\"Complete?\"}\n    C -->|\"No\"| D[\"Reject and Guide\"]\n    C -->|\"Yes\"| E[\"Create Case\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Triage & Review\"\n    E --> F{\"Imminent Harm?\"}\n    F -->|\"Yes\"| G[\"Temporarily Hide Content\"]\n    F -->|\"No\"| H[\"Queue by Priority\"]\n    G --> I[\"Expedited Review\"]\n    H --> I\n    I --> J{\"Decision\"}\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Actions\"\n    J -->|\"No Action\"| K[\"Close Case\"]\n    J -->|\"Warn/Suspend\"| L[\"Apply Sanction\"]\n    J -->|\"Hide/Delete\"| M[\"Apply Content Action\"]\n    J -->|\"Edit Request\"| N[\"Request Changes from Author\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Appeal\"\n    O[\"File Appeal\"] --> P[\"Assign Different Reviewer\"]\n    P --> Q{\"Appeal Outcome\"}\n    Q -->|\"Upheld\"| R[\"Reverse Action and Restore\"]\n    Q -->|\"Denied\"| S[\"Maintain Action\"]\n  end\n\n  K --> T[\"Notify Parties\"]\n  L --> T\n  M --> T\n  N --> T\n  R --> T\n  S --> T\n```\n\n## Notification Settings and Receipt Flow\nDefines how users configure preferences and how notifications are delivered in real time or digest, respecting rate limits and user control.\n\n### Narrative Flow\n- Preference management: Users opt in/out per channel (in-app, email) and per category (mentions, replies, follows, moderation updates, policy events). Users may select digest frequency for summaries.\n- Triggering: Events such as mentions, comments, follows, publication outcomes, and moderation decisions trigger notifications. The system evaluates user preferences, quiet hours, and rate limits before sending.\n- Delivery: Real-time where required; batched aggregation for digest per chosen interval. Failures are retried per policy. Users can view notification history.\n\n### Role Notes\n- All roles receive notifications appropriate to their actions and responsibilities. Moderators also receive queue assignments; admins receive policy/legal event notifications.\n\n### EARS Requirements (Notifications)\n- WHEN a trigger event occurs, THE notification service SHALL evaluate the recipient's preferences and channel availability before queuing delivery.\n- WHERE a user has enabled digest for a category, THE notification service SHALL aggregate events and deliver at the configured interval.\n- IF a user has opted out for a channel or category, THEN THE notification service SHALL suppress delivery for that scope.\n- WHEN a delivery attempt fails transiently, THE notification service SHALL retry according to backoff policy and record failure if exhausted.\n- WHEN a notification pertains to moderation outcomes, THE notification service SHALL include outcome, rationale summary, and available next steps.\n- THE notification service SHALL respect configured rate limits and quiet hours for non-critical categories.\n- WHERE an event is critical (security or policy), THE notification service SHALL bypass quiet hours for the minimum necessary alerting.\n\n### Notification Flow Diagram\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Preference Management\"\n    A[\"Open Preferences\"] --> B[\"Set Channels\"]\n    B --> C[\"Set Categories\"]\n    C --> D[\"Set Digest Frequency\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Trigger & Evaluation\"\n    E[\"Event Triggered\"] --> F[\"Load Recipient Preferences\"]\n    F --> G{\"Opted Out?\"}\n    G -->|\"Yes\"| H[\"Suppress\"]\n    G -->|\"No\"| I{\"Digest Category?\"}\n    I -->|\"Yes\"| J[\"Aggregate for Digest\"]\n    I -->|\"No\"| K[\"Queue for Real-Time Delivery\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Delivery\"\n    K --> L[\"Attempt Delivery\"]\n    L --> M{\"Success?\"}\n    M -->|\"Yes\"| N[\"Record Sent\"]\n    M -->|\"No\"| O[\"Retry per Policy\"]\n    O --> P{\"Exhausted?\"}\n    P -->|\"Yes\"| Q[\"Record Failure\"]\n    P -->|\"No\"| L\n    J --> R[\"Send Digest at Interval\"]\n  end\n```\n\n## Role-Based Approval and Gating Points\nAuthorization gates differ by role for certain actions. Business rules are expressed in EARS to remove ambiguity.\n\n### EARS Requirements (Role Gates)\n- WHERE the actor is member, THE content service SHALL allow publishing own posts subject to policy checks without mandatory staff pre-approval.\n- WHERE the actor is expert and marks content as “long-form research”, THE content service SHALL require either source completeness verification or editor review prior to publication.\n- WHERE the actor is editor, THE curation service SHALL permit pinning and featuring but SHALL require moderator approval to enforce policy violations.\n- WHERE the actor is moderator, THE governance service SHALL allow content hide/remove and SHALL require admin approval for permanent account sanctions.\n- WHERE the actor is admin, THE governance service SHALL allow irreversible sanctions and legal-policy overrides with mandatory audit logging.\n\n### Role Gate Diagram\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Actors\"\n    A[\"Member\"]\n    B[\"Expert\"]\n

Exception Branches and Rollback Flows\nCross-flow exception handling paths and rollback behaviors expressed in EARS with a consolidated diagram.\n\n### EARS Requirements (Exceptions & Rollbacks)\n- IF registration input validation fails, THEN THE authentication service SHALL not create an account and SHALL provide actionable guidance without revealing sensitive validation logic.\n- IF email verification is attempted with an invalid or expired token, THEN THE authentication service SHALL deny activation and SHALL offer a new verification process.\n- IF token refresh is attempted after refresh expiration, THEN THE authentication service SHALL require re-authentication and SHALL deny access until successful sign-in.\n- IF an author loses connectivity during draft save, THEN THE content service SHALL retain the last confirmed version and SHALL surface a reconciliation prompt on next restore.\n- IF pre-publish checks detect policy violations, THEN THE content service SHALL preserve the draft, SHALL enumerate violations, and SHALL block publication until resolved.\n- IF a moderation action is applied in error and later reversed, THEN THE governance service SHALL restore content visibility and SHALL update all related notifications and transparency records.\n- IF notification delivery repeatedly fails for a channel, THEN THE notification service SHALL mark the channel as temporarily unavailable for the recipient and SHALL suggest remediation steps via an alternative channel if available.\n- WHEN a user requests account-wide sign-out, THE authentication service SHALL revoke all devices within 1 minute and SHALL require fresh authentication for any new access.\n\n### Cross-Flow Rollback Diagram\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Draft Save Attempt\"] -->

for content governance, reporting, moderation actions, sanctions, transparency, and appeals, including special election-period policies aligned to domestic law.\n- Scope: applies to all user-generated content (UGC): posts, comments, replies, titles, tags, attachments, profile bios, display names, and any user-visible metadata or labels.\n- Principles:\n  - Legality: comply with applicable domestic regulations in the primary jurisdiction; prohibit unlawful content and behavior.\n  - Truthfulness: encourage evidence-based discourse; mitigate unverified or manipulative content through labels and distribution controls while preserving legitimate opinion.\n  - Proportionality: apply progressive sanctions proportional to severity and recurrence, with clear thresholds and windows.\n  - Due process: provide reason codes, timelines, and an appeal channel; record audit trails suitable for review.\n  - Transparency: publish aggregated moderation statistics, and provide user-facing case histories and outcomes.\n\nEARS (Foundational)\n- THE governance subsystem SHALL apply these policies consistently across roles, content types, and workflows.\n- THE governance subsystem SHALL maintain a standardized taxonomy for reason codes, decisions, sanctions, and closure statuses.\n\n## 2) Roles and Governance Responsibilities (Business)\n- member: may create and report content, block users, and receive sanctions; cannot sanction others.\n- expert: inherits member; can propose expert topics, publish in-depth research, participate in expert Q&A; must meet higher disclosure standards for affiliations/conflicts.\n- moderator: operates the moderation queue; can hide/remove content; can issue warnings and temporary suspensions up to 30 days; manages disputes; maintains transparency logs.\n- editor: curates featured content; manages announcements/pinned posts; edits topics/tags; may hide content for editorial quality but cannot sanction users; must escalate policy violations to moderators.\n- admin: full oversight; manages roles/policies; handles legal requests; may impose permanent sanctions; approves election-period configurations and policy updates.\n\nEARS (Roles)\n- THE governance subsystem SHALL enforce role-specific authorization boundaries and approval flows for all moderation actions.\n- WHERE the actor role is \"editor\", THE system SHALL restrict enforcement actions to temporary editorial hiding without user sanctions.\n- WHERE the actor role is \"moderator\", THE system SHALL allow warnings and suspensions of 24h/7d/30d and content removal within defined scope only.\n- WHERE the actor role is \"admin\", THE system SHALL allow permanent sanctions, role/policy changes, and election-policy activation.\n- WHEN any role performs a moderation-relevant action, THE system SHALL record actor role, action, target, timestamp, reason code, and outcome in an audit log.\n\n## 3) Community Rules: Allowed/Restricted/Prohibited Content\n3.1 Allowed with Expectations (Examples)\n- Opinion/Analysis framed as subjective perspective, clearly separated from factual assertions.\n- Critique of public policy/officials without doxxing or unlawful exposure of personal data.\n- Satire/Parody labeled to prevent confusion with factual reporting.\n\n3.2 Restricted (Require Labels/Disclaimers or Distribution Mitigation)\n- Unverified claims: require a \"Unverified\" label until a credible source is provided; visibility may be reduced pending sourcing.\n- Polls/Surveys: require methodology disclosure; incomplete disclosures receive \"Methodology Incomplete\" label.\n- Economic/Financial content: require a \"Not financial advice\" disclaimer.\n\n3.3 Prohibited (Immediate Enforcement)\n- Illegal content: threats, incitement to violence, doxxing, non-consensual personal information, targeted harassment, discriminatory hate content, sexual exploitation, unlawful solicitation.\n- Harmful misinformation: fabricated facts presented as truth with potential imminent harm (public safety, election procedure manipulation).\n- Spam/Manipulation: mass posting, link farming, coordinated inauthentic behavior, undisclosed paid political content, astroturfing.\n- Copyright infringement: unauthorized reproduction where rights-holder objection is likely.\n\nEARS (Classification & Mitigation)\n- THE governance subsystem SHALL maintain a canonical reason code set (e.g., ILLEGAL_THREAT, HATE_SPEECH, DOXXING, MISINFO_HARM, SPAM, COPYRIGHT, OFF_TOPIC, LOW_QUALITY, HARASSMENT, ELECTION_PROCEDURE_FALSE).\n- WHEN content is classified as prohibited, THE system SHALL immediately block public exposure and move it to \"Under Review\" state.\n- WHEN content requires labeling, THE system SHALL attach the specified label(s) and reduce algorithmic amplification until criteria are satisfied.\n- IF classification confidence is low, THEN THE system SHALL apply the \"Unverified\" label and route the item to the review queue without permanent action.\n\n## 4) Political-Sensitive Content Guidelines (Factuality, Source, Tone)\n4.1 Factuality\n- Assertions of fact must be verifiable via reliable sources (primary records, reputable media, official statistics). Opinions remain permissible if clearly framed.\n\n4.2 Sourcing\n- Political claims must include source citations (URL, publication, date). Missing sources trigger mitigation labels and reduced promotion.\n\n4.3 Expression Level\n- Robust debate is encouraged; dehumanizing language, slurs, calls for violence, and targeted harassment are

Scope and Intent\n- Establish verifiable and auditable business rules for creation, use, preservation, anonymization, and deletion of information across its lifecycle in the pol-econ-board service.\n- Clarify responsibilities and constraints by role (member, expert, moderator, editor, admin) over data states.\n- Align with the [Security and Compliance Requirements](./09-pol-econ-board-security-and-compliance.md) and the [Community Governance and Moderation Requirements](./07-pol-econ-board-community-governance-and-moderation.md).\n\n## 2. Definitions and Data Classes\n- Core data classes (business-level):\n  - Account Profile: minimal identity and preferences for member/expert/moderator/editor/admin.\n  - Post: authored content including title/body and metadata (topics, tags, visibility, language, content warnings, sources).\n  - Comment/Reply: discussion items attached to a post or comment; includes mentions.\n  - Reaction/Vote: engagement signals tied to posts or comments.\n  - Follow/Subscription/Bookmark: user-interest signals for topics, authors, or items.\n  - Report: user-submitted complaint about content or behavior.\n  - Moderation Record: decisions, reasons, sanctions, transparency notes.\n  - Notification Record: delivery attempts, status, category/channel, preferences snapshot.\n  - Audit Log: immutable traces of sensitive actions and lifecycle transitions.\n  - Metrics/Analytics Event: granular events and aggregated counters for business analytics (non-identifying beyond policy limits).\n  - Backup Artifact: point-in-time preservation of business records for disaster recovery.\n  - DSAR Record: data subject access/rectify/delete/portability requests and fulfillment artifacts (business tracking).\n  - Legal Hold Record: records of holds with scope, basis, approver, and review history.\n  - Taxonomy Change Record: topic/tag/category adjustments with effective dates and mapping notes.\n\n- Role scope (business perspective):\n  - Member/Expert: create and manage own content; request deletion; exercise data rights per policy.\n  - Moderator: handle reports; hide/remove content; propose or apply sanctions per policy scope; manage evidence and transparency entries.\n  - Editor: curate/pin/feature; manage taxonomy; no unilateral access to personal data beyond business need.\n  - Admin: oversee policy application; impose legal holds; manage roles/policies; access audit and transparency logs.\n\n## 3. Conceptual Data Flow Overview\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Creation\"\n    A1[\"Create Draft(Post/Comment)\"] --> A2[\"Validate & Classify\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Usage\"\n    B1[\"Publish & Engage\"] --> B2[\"Edit & Version\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Governance\"\n    C1[\"Report Submitted\"] --> C2[\"Moderation Review\"] --> C3[\"Decision/Sanction\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Preservation\"\n    D1[\"Audit Logging\"] --> D2[\"Backups & Metrics\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Disposition\"\n    E1[\"User/Policy Delete Request\"] --> E2[\"Soft Delete/Archive\"] --> E3[\"Permanent Deletion/Anonymize\"]\n  end\n  A2 --> B1\n  B2 -.-> D1\n  B1 --> D2\n  C3 --> D1\n  E1 --> D1\n```\n\n## 4. Global Lifecycle Concepts\n- States (business-level): Draft, Published, Edited (Versioned), Archived, Hidden (policy/moderation), Soft Deleted, Permanently Deleted, Under Hold (legal/moderation), Restored.\n- Transitions: Valid transitions are constrained by holds, appeals, and policy gates.\n\nEARS requirements (global):\n- WHILE 항목이 \"Under Hold\" 상태, THE lifecycle policy SHALL prohibit permanent deletion or anonymization for the affected records.\n- WHEN 상태 전이가 발생(create, publish, edit, archive, delete, restore, hold apply/release), THE lifecycle policy SHALL record actor role, timestamp, and reason in an immutable audit trail.\n- WHERE referential dependencies exist (e.g., comment → post), THE lifecycle policy SHALL preserve discussion continuity using placeholders when parents are removed.\n\n## 5. Post Lifecycle\nStates: Draft → Published → Edited (Versioned) → Archived (optional) → Deleted (Soft) → Permanently Deleted.\n\nCreation and drafts\n- WHEN a user saves a post as draft, THE service SHALL retain the draft for 90 days since last edit.\n- IF a draft remains inactive for 90 consecutive days, THEN THE service SHALL mark it for permanent deletion within 7 days.\n- THE service SHALL allow authors to self-delete drafts at any time; WHEN a draft is self-deleted, THE service SHALL purge it permanently within 7 days.\n\nPublishing and editing\n- WHEN a draft is published, THE service SHALL record a publication timestamp and initial version identifier.\n- WHEN an author edits a published post, THE service SHALL preserve the immediately prior version for 30 days for rollback and audit purposes unless a legal/moderation hold requires longer retention.\n- IF a published post is edited within 10 minutes of publication, THEN THE service SHALL treat the edit as a minor update not requiring separate archival unless content meaning materially changes per moderation rules.\n\nArchiving (business visibility management)\n- WHERE a post is older than 365 days without new engagement (views, comments, reactions), THE service SHALL be eligible to move it to an archived state where it remains readable but excluded from default feeds.\n- WHEN a post enters archived state, THE service SHALL maintain all references (comments, reactions) intact.\n\nDeletion\n- WHEN an author deletes a published post, THE service SHALL transition it to soft delete immediately, exclude it from public access, and begin a 30-day recovery window for the author.\n- WHEN the 30-day recovery window elapses without restoration, THE service SHALL permanently delete post body and attachments while retaining minimal non-content metadata (author pseudonymous identifier, deletion timestamp, content identifier) for 180 days for audit/abuse-prevention, after which THE service SHALL anonymize or delete such metadata unless under legal hold.\n- IF a post is under active moderation investigation or legal hold when deletion is requested, THEN THE service SHALL defer permanent deletion until the hold is lifted and SHALL inform the author through standard communication channels.\n\nCross-References\n- WHEN a post is permanently deleted, THE service SHALL remove or anonymize dependent objects per their own policies (e.g., comments by others remain but lose parent pointer visibility and show a \"missing parent\" placeholder; reactions are removed).\n\n### Visual: Post Lifecycle\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Draft\"] --> B[\"Published\"] --> C[\"Edited(Versioned)\"]\n  B --> D[\"Archived\"]\n  C --> D\n  B --> E[\"Soft Deleted\"]\n  E --> F[\"Permanently Deleted\"]\n  D --> E\n  subgraph \"Constraints\"\n    G[\"Under Hold\"]\n  end\n  E -.-> G\n  F -.-> G\n```\n\n## 6. Comment/Reply Lifecycle\nStates: Draft → Published → Edited → Deleted (Soft) → Permanently Deleted.\n\nDrafts and publishing\n- THE service SHALL apply the same draft retention rules as posts (90-day inactivity purge).\n- WHEN a comment is published, THE service SHALL record a publication timestamp and link to the parent post/comment.\n\nEditing\n- WHERE editing is permitted by policy, THE service SHALL allow comment edits within 24 hours of posting; WHEN edited, THE service SHALL keep a prior version for 7 days for moderation audit.\n\nDeletion\n- WHEN a commenter deletes their comment, THE service SHALL soft delete immediately and offer a 14-day recovery window.\n- WHEN the 14-day window elapses, THE service SHALL permanently delete comment content while retaining minimal non-content metadata for 90 days for audit unless under legal hold.\n- IF the comment has replies, THEN THE service SHALL display a \"comment removed\" placeholder at the business content layer and preserve reply visibility.\n\n## 7. Reactions and Votes\n- WHEN a user adds or removes a reaction or vote, THE service SHALL apply the change immediately and record an event in audit logs where required.\n- WHEN a user account is deleted, THE service SHALL delete or aggregate reactions and votes such that individual attribution is removed within 7 days.\n- THE service SHALL retain reaction events for 90 days for abuse detection, after which THE service SHALL aggregate or purge individual events, keeping only aggregate counts.\n\n## 8. Follows, Subscriptions, and Bookmarks\n- WHEN a user follows a topic or author, THE service SHALL store the preference until the user unfollows or the account is deleted.\n- WHEN a user removes a bookmark, THE service SHALL delete the bookmark record immediately and exclude it from backups after the standard retention window.\n- WHERE an account is deleted, THE service SHALL purge follows/subscriptions/bookmarks within 7 days.\n\n## 9. Account Profile and Preferences\n- WHEN an account is created, THE service SHALL store only minimal required profile fields and preferences per data minimization principle.\n- WHEN a user updates profile fields or preferences, THE service SHALL overwrite prior values and retain a change-audit entry for 180 days.\n- WHEN a user requests account deletion, THE service SHALL begin a 14-day cooling-off period during which sign-in cancels the deletion if the user explicitly revokes the request; after the period, THE service SHALL permanently delete or anonymize personal data except data needed for legal obligations or transparency logs.\n\n### Visual: Account Deletion Flow (Cooling-Off → Final Disposition)\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Account Deletion Request\"] --> B[\"Acknowledge(≤24h)\"] --> C[\"Cooling-Off(14d)\"]\n  C --> D{\"Revoked?\"}\n  D -->|\"Yes\"| E[\"Cancel Deletion\"]\n  D -->|\"No\"| F[\"Delete/Anonymize(≤15d)\"]\n  F --> G{\"Legal/Moderation Hold?\"}\n  G -->|\"Yes\"| H[\"Defer Until Hold Lifted\"]\n  G -->|\"No\"| I[\"Confirm Completion\"]\n```\n\n## 10. Report/Moderation Lifecycle and Evidence Retention\nStates: Reported → Triaged → Under Review → Decision → Sanction (if any) → Appeal → Finalized.\n\nReport intake\n- WHEN a report is submitted, THE service SHALL timestamp, classify, and place it into the moderation queue.\n- THE service SHALL preserve report details and a referenced content snapshot at time of report for evidence.\n\nReview and decision\n- WHEN a moderator opens a report, THE service SHALL record reviewer role, actions taken, and timing for transparency.\n- WHEN a decision is issued, THE service SHALL store decision, rationale, and policy references.\n\nEvidence retention\n- THE service SHALL retain report records, content snapshots used as evidence, and moderation decisions for 2 years from finalization unless stricter statutory requirements apply.\n- IF a sanction includes account suspension or permanent ban, THEN THE service SHALL retain minimal identifiers necessary to enforce sanctions for the sanction duration plus 2 years.\n\nAppeals and interactions\n- WHEN an appeal is filed within the allowed window, THE service SHALL lock evidence from deletion until appeal closure.\n- WHEN an appeal concludes, THE service SHALL reset the retention start to the appeal closure date.\n- IF the reported content’s author requests deletion, THEN THE service SHALL keep evidence under hold until the case is finalized, then apply standard deletion rules.\n\nReference: [Community Governance and Moderation Requirements](./07-pol-econ-board-community-governance-and-moderation.md).\n\n## 11. Logs, Metrics, DSARs, and Backups: Retention and Disposal\nAudit and security logs\n- THE service SHALL retain authentication, authorization, and sensitive action audit logs for 180 days at minimum and up to 1 year where required by internal policy.\n- WHERE logs contain personal identifiers, THE service SHALL pseudonymize identifiers within 30 days unless strict identity is required for ongoing investigations.\n\nTransparency logs\n- THE service SHALL retain public-facing transparency records of moderation actions for 2 years, with personal data minimized and pseudonymized where possible.\n\nOperational metrics and analytics\n- THE service SHALL retain granular metrics and event samples for 90 days; after 90 days THE service SHALL keep only aggregated, non-identifying statistics for longitudinal analysis.\n\nNotification delivery logs\n- THE service SHALL retain notification delivery attempts and outcomes for 90 days to support troubleshooting and opt-in/opt-out proof.\n\nDSAR records\n- THE service SHALL retain DSAR request logs and responses for 2 years for audit and compliance, with personal data minimized.\n\nBackups (business-level principles)\n- THE service SHALL maintain daily recovery points sufficient to restore to a business-acceptable point-in-time; WHERE monthly full retention applies, THE service SHALL retain monthly recovery points for 3 months and daily recovery points for 30 days.\n- IF a user exercises deletion rights, THEN THE service SHALL ensure deleted personal data ages out of backup media within 35 days after deletion completion, acknowledging backup immutability windows.\n- THE service SHALL document and publish effective backup retention windows for audit.\n\nDisposal\n- WHEN retention expires and no legal or moderation hold exists, THE service SHALL dispose of logs, metrics, DSAR records, and backups in an irreversible manner and record disposal in audit entries.\n\n## 12. Anonymization and Pseudonymization Requirements\nPseudonymization\n- WHEN storing data for audit or transparency, THE service SHALL replace direct personal identifiers with stable pseudonymous identifiers sufficient for role-based review but insufficient for public re-identification.\n- WHERE cross-record correlation is necessary for abuse detection, THE service SHALL use rotating pseudonymous identifiers that change at most every 90 days while maintaining internal linkage.\n\nAnonymization\n- WHEN permanent deletion is required but analytics value remains, THE service SHALL anonymize records by removing or irreversibly altering personal identifiers and quasi-identifiers so re-identification is not reasonably possible.\n- IF anonymization cannot guarantee non-reidentifiability for a dataset, THEN THE service SHALL opt for full deletion.\n\nRe-identification prohibition and documentation\n- THE service SHALL prohibit attempts to reverse pseudonymization/anonymization and SHALL record violations as security incidents.\n- THE service SHALL maintain a business-level data dictionary mapping data classes to anonymization/pseudonymization strategies.\n\n## 13. User-Requested Deletion and Recovery\nContent deletion by author\n- WHEN an author deletes own content (posts or comments), THE service SHALL begin the applicable recovery window (30 days for posts, 14 days for comments) and provide a self-service restoration option during that window.\n- WHEN content is restored during the window, THE service SHALL reinstate visible links and engagement counts except those already purged by separate user actions.\n\nAccount deletion\n- WHEN a verified user submits an account deletion request, THE service SHALL acknowledge within 24 hours, start a 14-day cooling-off period, and communicate the scheduled deletion date.\n- WHEN the cooling-off period ends without revocation, THE service SHALL delete/anonymize personal data within 15 additional days and notify the user of completion if channels remain valid.\n- WHERE legal obligations require retention (e.g., moderation transparency, fraud prevention), THE service SHALL retain only minimal necessary data and SHALL document the legal basis.\n\nExceptions and holds\n- IF an active moderation case, payment dispute, or legal hold exists, THEN THE service SHALL defer deletion until closure and SHALL inform the user of deferral reason and next steps.\n\nRecovery portal\n- THE service SHALL provide a history of user-initiated deletions within the active recovery window and SHALL allow one-click restoration by the owner.\n- WHERE recovery would violate a moderation decision, THE service SHALL block restoration and display the applicable policy reference in user-facing communications.\n\n## 14. Legal Hold and Exceptions\n- WHEN an Admin establishes a legal hold for specific subjects or data classes, THE service SHALL freeze deletion and anonymization actions for affected records until the hold is explicitly lifted.\n- THE service SHALL record the hold’s scope, reason (business reference), start/end timestamps, and approver role in the audit log and SHALL review active holds every 90 days.\n\n## 15. Retention Matrix (Business Summary)\n\n| Data Category | State/Trigger | Retention Policy | Deletion Type | Recovery Window | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Draft Posts/Comments | Last edit inactive | Delete after 90 days inactivity; purge within 7 days | Permanent | N/A | User can self-delete anytime |\n| Published Post Versions | Edit event | Prior version kept 30 days | Auto purge 30 days | N/A | Longer if under hold |\n| Posts (Author-deleted) | Soft deleted | Recovery 30 days; then delete content; metadata 180 days | Permanent (content); anonymize metadata | 30 days | Defer if under hold |\n| Comments (Author-deleted) | Soft deleted | Recovery 14 days; then delete content; metadata 90 days | Permanent (content); anonymize metadata | 14 days | Placeholder remains |\n| Reactions/Votes | Event created | Keep raw 90 days; keep aggregates indefinitely | Aggregate only | N/A | Remove attribution on account deletion (7 days) |\n| Follows/Bookmarks | Preference removed | Immediate deletion | Permanent | N/A | Purge within 7 days on account deletion |\n| Account Profiles | Deletion requested | 14-day cooling; delete/anonymize within +15 days | Permanent/Anonymize | N/A | Minimal retention if required by law |\n| Reports & Evidence | Finalization/Appeal close | 2 years | N/A | N/A | Extend under legal requirements |\n| Audit/Security Logs | Log creation | 180 days up to 1 year | Permanent | N/A | Pseudonymize in 30 days unless needed |\n| Transparency Logs | Action published | 2 years | N/A | N/A | Personal data minimized |\n| Metrics/Analytics | Event creation | Granular 90 days; aggregates thereafter | Aggregate | N/A | Non-identifying aggregates |\n| Notification Logs | Event creation | 90 days | Permanent | N/A | Proof of consent history |\n| DSAR Records | Request closure | 2 years | Permanent | N/A | Minimized content |\n| Backups | Recovery point creation | Daily 30 days; Monthly 3 months | Secure destruction | N/A | Deleted data ages out ≤35 days |\n| Taxonomy Change Records | Change applied | 1 year | Permanent | N/A | For curation audit |\n| Legal Hold Records | Hold creation | Duration of hold + 2 years | N/A | N/A | Scope/review trail retained |\n\n## 16. Error Handling and Edge Cases (Business)\nConflicts and holds\n- IF a user requests deletion while a legal or moderation hold exists, THEN THE service SHALL process the request to the extent possible and queue the remainder until the hold is lifted, with user notification per communications policy.\n\nReferential integrity\n- WHEN a parent post is permanently deleted, THE service SHALL ensure that child comments remain visible if policy allows, with a clear placeholder and without broken navigation.\n\nPartial failures\n- IF a deletion workflow partially completes, THEN THE service SHALL mark the item as \"deletion pending\" and retry within 24 hours until completion or hold.\n\nRace conditions\n- WHEN simultaneous restore and delete actions occur within a recovery window, THE service SHALL prioritize the most recent, explicitly confirmed user action and record the decision in the audit log.\n\nAttachments and embedded media\n- WHEN content is deleted, THE service SHALL apply the same retention schedule to associated attachments and embedded media unless under hold.\n\nData residency and localization (business-level)\n- WHERE data residency constraints apply, THE service SHALL ensure residency-compliant storage locations for preserved data classes and SHALL document residency scope in audit.\n\n## 17. Auditability and Policy Governance\nLifecycle event logging\n- THE service SHALL record lifecycle transitions (create, publish, edit, archive, delete, restore, hold apply/release) with actor role, timestamp, and reason in an immutable audit trail accessible to Admins for compliance review.\n\nPolicy versioning\n- THE service SHALL maintain a versioned registry of lifecycle and retention rules; WHEN rules change, THE service SHALL apply new rules prospectively and SHALL not retroactively shorten required legal retention unless permitted by law.\n\nReviews and certification\n- THE service SHALL review lifecycle and retention practices at least annually and after major regulatory updates, certifying compliance status at the business level.\n\nMinimization and purpose limitation\n- THE service SHALL collect and retain only data necessary for the stated purpose and duration, as detailed in the [Security and Compliance Requirements](./09-pol-econ-board-security-and-compliance.md).\n\n## 18. Performance and Success Criteria\nVerifiability\n- WHEN auditors review samples, THE service SHALL demonstrate adherence to stated retention timelines within ±2 days for date-specific windows where no holds existed.\n\nUser experience timing\n- WHEN users delete content, THE service SHALL remove content from user-facing views within 1 minute and complete background cleanup according to this policy.\n\nBackup aging\n- WHEN users exercise deletion rights, THE service SHALL verify that personal data no longer appears in restore points older than 35 days after deletion completion.\n\nTransparency\n- THE service SHALL produce a quarterly summary of deletions, holds, appeals, and restoration events without exposing personal data.\n\nProcessing deadlines\n- WHERE anonymization is selected instead of deletion, THE service SHALL complete anonymization within the same deadlines as deletion for the relevant data class.\n\n---\nBusiness requirements only;

Notifications and Communications Requirements — pol-econ-board\n\n## 1) Scope and Principles\n- Coverage: In-app notifications, email communications, and batch/digest messages related to user activity, content interactions, moderation/governance, editorial operations, and account/security events.\n- Exclusions: Frontend UI layouts, transport/infrastructure specifics, vendor/protocol details, code or API definitions.\n- Goals: Timely, relevant, controllable, and compliant communications that respect user consent and minimize noise.\n- Timezone: THE notifications program SHALL operate on user-local timezone; WHERE user timezone is unknown, the default SHALL be Asia/Seoul (KST).\n\nEARS Principles\n- THE communications policy for pol-econ-board SHALL prioritize user control (opt-in/opt-out, preferences), relevance, timeliness, and minimal intrusiveness.\n- THE communications policy SHALL distinguish transactional messages (account/security/obligatory) and non-transactional messages (community growth/marketing/editorial digests).\n- THE communications service SHALL support user-local scheduling for batch and digest deliveries with Asia/Seoul as default.\n- THE communications service SHALL maintain compliance with privacy and consent boundaries for all channels and categories.\n\n## 2) Notification Taxonomy and Trigger Events\n\nCategories (business-level)\n- Account & Security (transactional): sign-up verification, password reset, password changed, email change confirmation, device/session revocation confirmation, role change.\n- Engagement (community interactions): mention, direct reply to a user’s post/comment, new post by followed author, new post in followed topic, expert Q&A invitation or assignment, content featured notification, new follower.\n- Moderation & Governance: content reported about user, auto-hide applied, decision issued (warning/suspension), appeal received, appeal outcome, report assigned to moderator, SLA reminder for open reports.\n- Editorial Operations: draft submitted for review, review decision, scheduled publish reminder, featured/curated selection, special topic program updates.\n- Digests & Summaries: daily/weekly topic digest, author digest, personalized activity summary, moderator/editor ops digests (role-scoped).\n\nEvent-driven Requirements (representative and testable)\n- WHEN a user is mentioned in a post or comment, THE notification service SHALL create a mention notification for the mentioned user.\n- WHEN a new reply is posted to a user’s comment, THE notification service SHALL prepare and deliver a reply notification to the original commenter per preferences.\n- WHEN a followed topic publishes a new post, THE notification service SHALL consult the recipient’s category/channel preferences and applicable limits before delivery.\n- WHEN a followed author publishes multiple posts within 10 minutes, THE notification service SHALL coalesce the events into a single notification for that window.\n- WHEN an expert Q&A answer request is assigned to an expert, THE notification service SHALL generate a high-priority real-time notification to the expert.\n- WHEN a user’s content is reported and moderation begins, THE notification service SHALL notify the author that review has started while minimizing sensitive identifiers.\n- WHEN a new report is assigned to a moderator, THE notification service SHALL dispatch a priority notification to the assigned moderator.\n- WHEN a draft is submitted to the review queue, THE notification service SHALL notify the responsible editor of the review request.\n- WHEN a review decision is recorded as approved or changes requested, THE notification service SHALL notify the author of the outcome with reason summary.\n- WHEN a security-sensitive account event occurs (password reset request, email change confirmation), THE notification service SHALL dispatch transactional notifications without delay.\n- WHEN the scheduled weekly digest window arrives, THE notification service SHALL aggregate the user’s followed sources and compile a summary.\n- WHEN a user gains a new follower, THE notification service SHALL create an engagement notification per the recipient’s preferences and rate limits.\n- WHEN a user’s post is featured by editors, THE notification service SHALL inform the author with the feature context.\n\nUbiquitous Rules (classification and envelope)\n- THE notification service SHALL apply a category tag (account/security, engagement, moderation, editorial, digest) to every notification.\n- THE notification service SHALL include a unique identifier, creation timestamp (with user timezone reference), category, priority, and related resource reference in every notification.\n\n## 3) Channels, Frequency, and Rate Limits\n\nChannels\n- In-app: notification center entries and badges (user-visible counters).\n- Email: transactional and digest communications.\n\nChannel Assignment (policy)\n- WHERE the event is transactional (account/security), THE notification service SHALL use In-app + Email as default channels.\n- WHERE the event is engagement (mentions/replies), THE notification service SHALL use In-app by default and use Email only if the user has enabled Email for that category.\n- WHERE the event is digest, THE notification service SHALL use Email for the digest and provide an In-app summary card.\n- WHERE the event targets moderators/editors/admins for operational duties, THE notification service SHALL support both In-app and Email according to their role preferences.\n\nFrequency and Rate Limits (per user unless specified)\n- THE notification service SHALL enforce a global per-user cap of up to 200 In-app notifications/day and up to 20 Emails/day.\n- WHERE engagement events relate to the same post/thread, THE notification service SHALL coalesce events into a single notification within a 10-minute window.\n- WHERE followed-author events occur within 10 minutes, THE notification service SHALL roll up into one notification.\n- WHERE digest delivery is enabled, THE notification service SHALL limit frequency to Daily or Weekly, and SHALL not allow both simultaneously per digest type.\n- WHILE a user has DND (Do Not Disturb) hours configured, THE notification service SHALL defer real-time non-transactional notifications until DND ends; transactional alerts may bypass DND.\n\nPerformance Expectations (aligned with Non-Functional Requirements)\n- THE notification service SHALL make In-app notifications available within 5 seconds at P95 and within 15 seconds at P99 under normal conditions.\n- THE notification service SHALL enqueue transactional Emails within 2 minutes at P95 and digests within 10 minutes at P95 from their scheduled time.\n\nBurst and Abuse Protections\n- WHERE event volume exceeds 50 notifications/hour for a single recipient outside digests, THE notification service SHALL throttle non-critical engagement notifications to protect experience and suggest digest mode.\n- IF a recipient reaches the daily Email cap, THEN THE notification service SHALL defer non-critical Email notifications to the next digest or the next day per user preference.\n\n## 4) Subscription, Follow, and Digest Policies\n\nFollow Defaults\n- WHEN a user follows a topic or author, THE notification service SHALL set the default alert level to “In-app real-time” for that source.\n- WHERE a user unfollows a source, THE notification service SHALL cease future notifications from that source immediately across all channels.\n\nDigest Composition and Scheduling\n- THE notification service SHALL include up to 10 highlight items per digest, prioritizing engagement and followed-source relevance.\n- WHERE the Daily Digest is enabled, THE notification service SHALL deliver between 07:00 and 09:00 user-local time using a randomized slot within the window.\n- WHERE the Weekly Digest is enabled, THE notification service SHALL deliver on Mondays between 08:00 and 10:00 user-local time.\n- THE notification service SHALL exclude items already consumed In-app during the digest period to avoid redundancy.\n\nCoalescing and Deduplication\n- THE notification service SHALL present a single roll-up notification when more than one event of the same type occurs within a 10-minute window, incrementing a count.\n- IF duplicate creation conditions are detected for the same recipient and resource, THEN THE notification service SHALL suppress subsequent duplicates.\n\n## 5) Consent Management and Preference Settings\n\nConsent Boundaries\n- THE notification service SHALL treat transactional messages as permitted under the service contract and essential operations.\n- THE notification service SHALL send non-transactional (marketing/community growth/editorial) messages only with explicit opt-in for the relevant categories.\n\nPreference Model\n- THE notification service SHALL provide category × channel toggles for: account/security, engagement, follows (authors/topics), moderation, editorial, digest; channels: In-app, Email.\n- WHERE no explicit user setting exists, THE notification service SHALL apply rational defaults: engagement In-app=ON, Email=OFF; follows In-app=ON, Email=OFF; digest Email=Weekly ON; account/security Email=ON.\n- THE notification service SHALL support DND windows (e.g., 22:00–08:00 user-local) and Snooze durations (e.g., 2h/8h/24h).\n- THE notification service SHALL support Mute at author/post/topic granularity to block notifications from specific sources.\n\nUser Control Actions\n- WHEN a user uses the unsubscribe link in an Email, THE notification service SHALL immediately stop Email delivery for that message category for the user.\n- WHEN a user opts out of all marketing/community messages, THE notification service SHALL prohibit delivery of such messages across all channels.\n- WHEN a user changes preferences, THE notification service SHALL apply the changes to subsequent events immediately.\n\nProof and Audit of Consent\n- THE notification service SHALL record the timestamp, scope, and channel for opt-ins and opt-outs to support audit and compliance inquiries.\n\n## 6) Message Composition and Tone Guidelines\n\nMessage Structure and Limits\n- THE notification service SHALL provide a title (max 80 characters), a summary (max 140 characters), and a core sentence in the body copy for clarity.\n- THE notification service SHALL avoid including sensitive personal data (full email addresses, phone numbers, exact locations) in notification bodies.\n- THE notification service SHALL use descriptive link text in messages (avoid “click here”).\n\nTone and Content\n- THE notification service SHALL maintain a factual, neutral, and non-inflammatory tone appropriate to political/economic topics.\n- THE notification service SHALL include minimal sufficient context (e.g., post title) and a direct link to the relevant resource.\n\nLocalization and Accessibility\n- THE notification service SHALL localize message content to the user’s preferred language; the baseline default is en-US.\n- THE notification service SHALL provide accessible copy suitable for assistive technologies and avoid color-only or icon-only significance.\n\nBrand Safety and Safety Checks\n- IF prohibited terms,

Business requirements only; all technical implementation decisions (architecture, APIs, database design, libraries) are owned by the development team. Describes WHAT must happen, not HOW to build it.\n\n## 1. Purpose and Scope\n- Standardize error taxonomy, user-facing messaging, recovery flows, and cross-cutting policies across authentication, authorization, content operations, moderation, external integrations, rate limiting/spam control, notification delivery, system incidents, and data integrity.\n- Ensure consistent, actionable responses with measurable performance targets and user recovery guidance.\n- Define testable, unambiguous requirements using EARS syntax.\n\n## 2. Related Documents\n- User and role definitions with authentication policies: [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./03-pol-econ-board-user-roles-and-authentication.md).\n- End-to-end feature behaviors and validations: [Functional Requirements for pol-econ-board](./04-pol-econ-board-functional-requirements.md).\n- Visual user journeys and decision branches: [User Flow Diagrams and Journeys](./06-pol-econ-board-user-flows.md).\n\n## 3. Common Error Taxonomy and User Message Principles\n\n### 3.1 Error Categories and Codes\n- Categories (business-level): AUTH, PERM, ACCOUNT, SESSION, CONTENT, UPLOAD, CONFLICT, MODERATION, REPORT, INTEGRATION, RATE_LIMIT, SPAM, DATA, VALIDATION, NOTIFICATION, SYSTEM.\n- Error code format: CATEGORY_SUBJECT_REASON (UPPERCASE with underscores). Examples: AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS, CONTENT_VERSION_CONFLICT, RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED, INTEGRATION_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE, DATA_DUPLICATE_SUBMISSION, SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE_ACTIVE.\n- Severity levels (business impact): INFO (no user action required), WARNING (user action suggested), ERROR (user action required), CRITICAL (widespread impact; some features degraded or unavailable).\n\n### 3.2 Standard Error Payload (Business-Level Content)\nBusiness information the response must convey to users and audit (not an API schema):\n- errorCode (follows format above)\n- title (short human-readable summary)\n- message (actionable description with next steps and context bounds)\n- userAction (specific recommended user step)\n- supportId (opaque identifier for support/audit; unique per incident)\n- category (one from §3.1)\n- severity (INFO/WARNING/ERROR/CRITICAL)\n- retryAfter (optional; seconds or timestamp for earliest retry)\n\n### 3.3 User Message Principles\n- Clarity: plain language; no jargon, stack traces, or internal error dumps.\n- Actionability: include what the user can do now and when to try again.\n- Non-disclosure: hide sensitive internals (validation heuristics, internal IDs, provider secrets, exact anti-abuse thresholds).\n- Consistency: uniform tone, structure, and placement across modules; predictable codes.\n- Localization: messages localized to the user’s language; placeholders substituted correctly; sensitive content neutral.\n- Accessibility: concise text alternatives; avoid color-only signals; no emoji-only indicators.\n\n### 3.4 Performance Expectations for Error Responses\n- Detection-to-display latency: ≤ 1.0 second for synchronous actions; ≤ 5.0 seconds for asynchronous confirmations.\n- Retryability hints: provided in the same response when applicable.\n- supportId: present for all ERROR and CRITICAL severities.\n\n## 4.
