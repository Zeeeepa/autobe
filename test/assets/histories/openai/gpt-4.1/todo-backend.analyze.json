The application serves as a digital backbone for personal productivity, allowing users to structure their actions, focus on priorities, and capture information at the speed of daily life. THE todoList service SHALL empower users through ownership and privacy, making productivity accessible and intuitive for all skill levels (EARS format).\n\n# Market Gap and Justification\n\nIn a digital landscape saturated with complex productivity and project management tools, users often experience feature fatigue, privacy concerns, and friction from setup bloat. The market is divided between enterprise-grade suites with steep learning curves and basic note-keeping apps that lack sufficient structure or security controls. Current user dissatisfaction surfaces as:\n- Overly complex onboarding and navigation in full-service work management apps\n- Lack of ownership/privacy over personal task data\n- Limited cross-device accessibility and cumbersome synchronization\n- Unclear boundaries between shared/collaborative features vs. private, individual workflow\n\ntodoList targets the critical segment of solo users—including individuals, freelancers, and students—who require: simplicity, data security, responsive access from multiple devices, and protection from workspace clutter or unwanted data sharing. WHEN a user seeks a quick, trustworthy tool to capture and execute personal tasks, THE todoList application SHALL provide a clear, distraction-free, and privacy-respecting experience (EARS format). Compared to collaborative-focused tools, todoList fills the market gap for a truly personal, secure productivity solution.\n\n# Core Value Proposition\n\n- Direct, frictionless creation and management of todo items via intuitive business-flows with no hidden sharing or delegation\n- THE todoList service SHALL provide robust, always-on privacy and security for all user data, including tasks, metadata, and session activities (EARS format)\n- WHEN a user accesses their account—whether from desktop or mobile—THE service SHALL instantly synchronize their personal todos, guaranteeing real-time access with no visible delays or data mismatch (EARS format)\n- THE system SHALL ensure that all actions and data remain exclusive to the authenticated user's context, with no external access possible (EARS format)\n- Role mapping (see Operating Model): only the \"basicUser\" role is permitted; every functional capability is anchored to the authenticated user account. THERE ARE NO shared, managerial, or admin roles within the MVP scope.\n- Unlike bloated \"all-in-one\" productivity suites, todoList exists solely to allow users to list, refine, and complete actionable items in a distraction-free, focused and secure environment\n- THE todoList service SHALL never require users to share or reveal personal information beyond what is essential for registration and secure operation (EARS format)\n\n# Operating Model\n\n## User Journey and Lifecycle\n\n- User Role: **basicUser** (registers, authenticates, performs full CRUD on their own todos)\n- Authentication is required for all business features; anonymous access is not permitted\n- WHEN a user completes the registration process (unique email, minimum password criteria), THE system SHALL immediately provision a personal workspace and grant permission to begin creating todo items (EARS format)\n- WHEN a user is authenticated, THE system SHALL restrict all CRUD operations to the user's own data—no visibility or access to others' todos is permitted under any scenario (EARS format)\n- WHEN a user logs out, THE system SHALL revoke session access and require re-authentication for all business actions (EARS format)\n- WHEN a user account is deleted, THE system SHALL irreversibly remove all associated todo data and session context within 48 hours, subject only to minimum privacy compliance retention (EARS format)\n\n### Permission Mapping and Boundaries\n\n| Feature                             | basicUser                   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Register                           | ✅ (unique email required)  |\n| Log in                             | ✅                          |\n| Log out                            | ✅                          |\n| Create todo                        | ✅ (only owns data)         |\n| Read own todos                     | ✅                          |\n| Update own todos                   | ✅                          |\n| Delete own todos                   | ✅                          |\n| View/manage others' todos          | ❌                          |\n| Share/Collaborate on todos         | ❌                          |\n| Access without authentication      | ❌                          |\n\n- THE system SHALL block every business function (except registration) for any unauthenticated user\n- THE CRUD lifecycle for todos (Create, Read, Update, Delete) is tightly mapped to ownership—no cross-user actions, no visibility of global task pools, and no admin moderation\n- All business operations are atomic and reported to the authenticated user's context only; error states, success indicators, and system feedback are scoped to the user's own session\n- WHEN a user encounters an error (invalid action, limit exceeded, or session timeout), THE system SHALL provide a clear, actionable, business-appropriate error message within 2 seconds (EARS format)\n\n## Authentication Workflow (Business Process Description)\n\n- Registration: Basic user submits email + password (minimum 8 characters, at least one letter and one number)\n- Login: Credential validation process returns a session and JWT access/refresh tokens (access: 15-minute expiry; refresh: 30 days)\n- Session maintenance: Authentication token required for all CRUD/todo actions; session expiry triggers forced re-login\n- Password recovery: Secure, time-limited procedures are provided for password reset, invalid login, or forgotten credentials\n- THE system SHALL prevent registration of duplicate emails and SHALL reject weak or malformed credentials (EARS format)\n- WHEN a user's session expires, THE service SHALL reject all further actions until re-authentication (EARS format)\n- WHEN password is changed or account deleted, THE system SHALL immediately invalidate all active sessions/tokens (EARS format)\n\nAll technical implementation for authentication and user state is at the discretion of developers. Requirements are expressed as user-observable behaviors and permission rules only.\n\n# Business Success Criteria\n\n- User Acquisition: WHEN a user visits the registration page, THE system SHALL convert a minimum of 30% of signups to active registered users within six months (EARS format)\n- Retention and Engagement: THE system SHALL consistently maintain a 30-day active user retention rate ≥ 40% across all registered accounts (EARS format)\n- User Satisfaction: THE todoList application SHALL solicit and analyze user feedback to achieve/maintain an average user rating ≥ 4.0/5.0 after one year (EARS format)\n- Security & Reliability: WHEN users access or update their todos, THE system SHALL complete standard CRUD operations or error returns within 2 seconds for ≥ 95% of user actions (EARS format)\n- Privacy Compliance: THE todoList service SHALL comply with all relevant data protection laws for every jurisdiction in which the service is offered (EARS format)\n- Error Recovery: WHEN a business or system error occurs, THE system SHALL provide a specific message and a recovery or retry option to the user within 2 seconds (EARS format)\n\n## Measurement and Review\n- All above KPIs and operational targets are tracked using aggregate system analytics every quarter; course corrections and enhancements are prioritized based on actual user data. Adjustments to thresholds or requirements are subject to change control per [Traceability and Change Management](./10-requirements-traceability.md).\n\n# Document References\n- For detailed user role flows and session management, see the [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md)\n- For an exhaustive list of end-user functional features, see the [Functional Requirements Specification](./03-functional-requirements.md)\n- For technical error flows and business boundary conditions, see the [Error Handling and Edge Cases Guide](./08-error-handling-and-edge-cases.md)\n- For privacy, session, and user data lifecycle rules, see the [Security and Privacy Requirements](./05-security-and-privacy.md)\n- Business model KPI traceability and control see [Requirements Traceability Matrix](./10-requirements-traceability.md)\n\n# Conclusion\n\ntodoList is established as a frictionless, privacy-centric productivity platform. THE service SHALL remain true to its business vision: providing personal, secure, and empowering todo management for the individual user. All requirements are defined in business terms; technical and architectural implementations are fully delegated to the development team. Users retain control of their data, boundaries are enforced by role, and business impact is measured by transparency, trust, and operational simplicity relative to the competitive market.

Introduction\nThe functional requirements for the backend of the todoList application define the complete set of business logic, workflows, user journeys, edge cases, and validation rules. Every requirement delineates WHAT the system must enforce, separated from technical implementation. The focus is on supporting the 'basicUser' role with full privacy, data integrity, and a reliable user-owned todo management lifecycle. Backend developers use these requirements as the authoritative specification for correct system behavior in all scenarios.\n\n## 2. List of User Stories/Functional Needs\n- As a basicUser, I can register, authenticate, and manage (create, read, update, delete) my own todos securely.\n- As a basicUser, I can see a complete and accurate list of all my personal todos, never any others'.\n- As a basicUser, I can create, update, delete, and mark as complete/incomplete only the todos that I own.\n- As a basicUser, I can review which todos are open and which are completed, and filter or view each status separately.\n- As a basicUser, I am never able to modify, delete, or even view todo items belonging to a different user.\n- As a basicUser, I will always receive clear validation and error messages in any scenario where an operation is rejected. \n- As a basicUser, I can create up to the business-defined limit of todo items.\n\n## 3. CRUD Operations on Todos\n### Create\n- WHEN a basicUser submits all required fields for a new todo, THE system SHALL create a todo item associated with that user only.\n- WHEN a todo is created, THE system SHALL set its status to 'incomplete' and initialize 'createdAt' as the creation timestamp (UTC).\n- WHEN required fields are missing, THE system SHALL reject the creation and specify which are missing (EARS).\n- IF a user is not authenticated, THEN THE system SHALL block todo creation and return an authentication-required error within 2 seconds (EARS).\n- IF a user's active todo count meets the business cap (e.g., 1000), THEN THE system SHALL block further creation until an old todo is deleted.\n\n### Read\n- WHEN a basicUser requests todos, THE system SHALL return all todos owned by the user, sorted by 'createdAt' descending (EARS).\n- WHEN a user requests a specific todo by ID, THE system SHALL return its details only if the todo belongs to the requesting user (EARS).\n- IF the requested todo does not exist or is not owned, THEN THE system SHALL return a 404 or forbidden error as appropriate.\n- WHERE filtering by status is requested, THE system SHALL limit the list to 'complete', 'incomplete', or both per user criteria.\n\n### Update\n- WHEN a basicUser updates a todo, THE system SHALL allow updates only if the todo belongs to the user, and SHALL update permitted fields.\n- WHEN a user marks a todo as complete, THE system SHALL record the 'completedAt' timestamp.\n- WHEN a completed todo is marked incomplete, THE system SHALL clear 'completedAt' and set status to 'incomplete'.\n- IF a user tries to update a todo they do not own, THEN THE system SHALL reject with clear permission error.\n- THE system SHALL update 'updatedAt' each time a todo is modified.\n- THE system SHALL permit field updates for title, body (if present), completion status, and optionally due date as per business rules.\n\n### Delete\n- WHEN a basicUser deletes a todo, THE system SHALL verify ownership and only remove the todo if owned by the user.\n- WHEN deletion is accepted, THE system SHALL immediately erase the todo and all associated business content (e.g., body/description).\n- IF a user attempts to delete a todo not owned by them, THEN THE system SHALL refuse with an explicit error.\n- WHEN deleting, THE system SHALL not allow accidental bulk deletion (no more than 10 todos in a single request, if supported by business rules).\n\n## 4. Completion/Incomplete Workflow\n- WHEN a user marks a todo as 'complete', THE system SHALL set its status to complete and set 'completedAt' to the transition time (UTC).\n- WHEN a user marks a previously-completed todo as 'incomplete', THE system SHALL revert its status and zero the 'completedAt' field.\n- WHILE todos are viewed, THE system SHALL represent completed/incomplete state in responses, enabling clients to visually distinguish them.\n- WHERE status filtering is requested, THE system SHALL filter todos solely by the specified status.\n- IF the user tries to complete a todo already complete, THEN THE system SHALL reject the action with a status error.\n\n## 5. Validation & Constraints\n- THE system SHALL treat title as a required, non-whitespace, string of 1-255 characters.\n- WHERE provided, THE system SHALL accept description/body text up to 1,000 characters.\n- WHERE provided, due date MUST be a valid date string (e.g., ISO-8601 format) representing a current or future date; past dates are invalid.\n- THE system SHALL validate all fields on creation and update, and enumerate every error encountered in the rejection response.\n- IF a field fails length, type, or business-format validation, THEN THE system SHALL specify the failed rule in plain language.\n- THE system SHALL only accept valid boolean values (true/false) for completion status.\n- THE system SHALL not persist todos with titles that are all whitespace.\n- WHERE user attempts to exceed their active todo quota, THE system SHALL return an error specifying the quota rule and unblock creation only after deletion.\n- THE system SHALL require all IDs to be unique, non-guessable, and consistently assigned per business design.\n\n| Field         | Required | Format/Max Length   | Notes                                    |\n|---------------|----------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| title         | Yes      | String, max 255    | No all-whitespace or empty titles         |\n| description   | No       | String, max 1000   | Optional, empty string if omitted         |\n| completed     | Yes      | Boolean            | true/false only, set by status           |\n| createdAt     | Yes      | UTC timestamp      | Set on creation, unmodified thereafter    |\n| updatedAt     | Yes      | UTC timestamp      | Updated on each edit, never on creation   |\n| completedAt   | No       | UTC timestamp      | Only if completed, must be cleared if undone |\n| ownerId       | Yes      | String             | Must match authenticated user's unique id |\n\n## 6. Business Workflow Diagram\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Todo Ownership\"\n    U[\"basicUser\"] --> C[\"Create Todo\"]\n    U --> R[\"Read Todos\"]\n    U --> U1[\"Update Own Todo\"]\n    U --> D[\"Delete Own Todo\"]\n    R --> F[\"Filter by Status\"]\n    U1 --> MC[\"Mark Complete\"]\n    MC --> UC[\"Mark Incomplete\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Permission Enforcement\"\n    X[\"Attempt Update/Delete Not Owned\"] --> E[\"Access Denied/Error\"]\n  end\n```\n\n## 7. Edge Cases and Limitations\n- IF a user attempts to view, update, or delete a todo they do not own, THEN THE system SHALL always return a 403 Forbidden error, never the actual todo.\n- IF a todo id is not found for the user (not existent or already deleted), THEN THE system SHALL return a 404 Not Found error.\n- IF the authenticated user's session or token is expired or invalid, THEN THE system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized error for all attempted operations.\n- WHEN the data store for todos is unavailable, THE system SHALL return a generic \"temporarily unavailable\" error and encourage retry within the hour.\n- IF the maximum todo count/quota for user is reached, THEN THE system SHALL block further creations and specify the quota rule in error.\n- IF a user submits malformed or excessively long fields, THEN THE system SHALL reject the request and enumerate the specific validation errors.\n- THE system SHALL avoid race conditions on concurrent updates: WHEN simultaneous edits occur, only the last committed update SHALL persist; others SHALL receive a conflict error upon save.\n- WHEN a user's todo list is empty, THE system SHALL return an empty list, never an error.\n- IF a password/session is reset or invalidated during operation, THEN THE system SHALL abort all in-progress todo operations and require a fresh login.\n\n## 8. Performance and User Experience Expectations\n- WHEN a user creates, updates, or deletes a todo, THE system SHALL respond with the new state (success/error) within 2 seconds under normal conditions.\n- THE system SHALL provide error codes and user-readable messages for all operational failures.\n- THE system SHALL consistently enforce validation and ownership checks before processing any operation.\n\n## 9. Supporting Business Processes and References\nComprehensive authentication, role, and session requirements are elaborated in the [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md). Cross-reference workflow is addressed in [User Journey Scenarios](./04-user-journeys.md). For validation rules and ownership boundary enforcement, see [Business Rules for Todo Management](./07-business-rules.md) and error handling details in [Error Handling and Edge Case Documentation](./08-error-handling-and-edge-cases.md).\n\nAll requirements focus exclusively on definitive backend business behavior for CRUD and adjunct user workflows in the todoList service. Technical strategy, stack, and implementation pattern are fully delegated to the development team.\n"},{"reason":"To provide a narrative walkthrough of typical user journeys, from first registration/login to managing todos, ensuring workflows are business-defined for smooth service operation and clear backend planning.","filename":"04-user-journeys.md","documentType":"user-story","outline":["Registration and First Login","Adding Todos","Updating and Marking Todos Complete","Deleting Todos","Error and Recovery Flows"],"audience":"product managers","keyQuestions":["What is the step-by-step user flow for basic operations?","What happens in abnormal or error situations?"],"detailLevel":"moderate detail","content":"## Registration and First Login\n\n### Narrative Flow\n\nA new user visits the Todo List application for the first time. The system presents an option to register. The registration process collects an email and a password which the user must provide. After submission, the system validates the entries and, upon successful validation, creates a new account for the user as a 'basicUser'. The user receives a confirmation and can proceed to log in.\n\n#### EARS Requirements\n- WHEN a user submits a registration form, THE system SHALL validate that the email is in a valid email address format.\n- WHEN a user submits a registration form, THE system SHALL validate that the password meets minimum security criteria (at least 8 characters, contains at least one number and one letter).\n- WHEN validation passes, THE system SHALL create a new user account assigned the basicUser role.\n- IF the email already exists in the system, THEN THE system SHALL display an error explaining that the account exists and recommend the user attempts to log in or recover their password.\n- IF registration succeeds, THEN THE system SHALL let the user immediately log in using their credentials.\n- WHEN a user logs in with correct credentials, THE system SHALL establish a session for that user, permitting access to all Todo features associated with the basicUser role.\n- IF a user enters incorrect credentials, THEN THE system SHALL display an error message.\n- IF there are three consecutive failed login attempts, THEN THE system SHALL temporarily lock out further login attempts for 60 seconds to prevent brute force login attempts.\n\n### Example Workflow (Mermaid)\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"User Opens Registration Page\"] --> B[\"User Inputs Email and Password\"]\n  B --> C[\"System Validates Inputs\"]\n  C -->|\"Success\"| D[\"Account Created as basicUser\"]\n  D --> E[\"User Logs In\"]\n  E --> F[\"Session Established\"]\n  C -->|\"Email Exists\"| G[\"Error: Account Exists\"]\n  C -->|\"Validation Fails\"| H[\"Error: Invalid Email/Password\"]\n  E -->|\"Incorrect Credentials\"| I[\"Error: Invalid Login\"]\n  I -->|\"3 Attempts\"| J[\"Lockout for 60 Seconds\"]\n```\n\n## Adding Todos\n\n### Narrative Flow\n\nAfter successful login, the user is presented with a main interface to manage their own todos. The user can add a new todo by entering a title and, optionally, a description and due date. The system validates the content—and on passing validation—creates a new todo associated only with the current user. All todos remain private to their owner.\n\n#### EARS Requirements\n- WHEN a logged-in basicUser submits a new todo, THE system SHALL validate required fields (non-empty title, description optional, due date optional).\n- IF the title is not provided or is blank, THEN THE system SHALL reject the todo creation and display an error indicating the requirement.\n- WHERE a due date is provided, THE system SHALL verify that the due date is a valid date and not in the past.\n- WHEN validation passes, THE system SHALL create a new todo uniquely linked to the current user's account.\n- THE system SHALL not grant access to any other user's todos.\n- THE system SHALL enforce a maximum of 100 active todos per user; IF a basicUser attempts to exceed this limit, THEN THE system SHALL reject the creation with a clear error message.\n\n### Example Workflow (Mermaid)\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"User Clicks 'Add Todo'\"] --> B[\"User Enters Title/Details\"]\n  B --> C[\"System Validates Fields\"]\n  C -->|\"Valid\"| D[\"Todo Created for User\"]\n  C -->|\"Invalid Title\"| E[\"Error: Title Required\"]\n  C -->|\"Invalid Due Date\"| F[\"Error: Date Invalid\"]\n  D --> G[\"Todos <= 100?\"]\n  G -->|\"No\"| H[\"Error: Max Todos Reached\"]\n```\n\n## Updating and Marking Todos Complete\n\n### Narrative Flow\n\nA user views their own list of todos and selects a todo to update its title, description, due date, or to mark it complete. The system validates all changes and ensures the todo remains uniquely owned by that user. Upon marking as complete, the system records completion time and updates the todo's status to 'complete'; incomplete todos remain editable.\n\n#### EARS Requirements\n- WHEN a basicUser updates a todo, THE system SHALL validate that the new title, if changed, remains non-empty.\n- WHERE a due date is updated, THE system SHALL ensure it is a valid date not in the past.\n- THE system SHALL only allow the owner (basicUser) to update their own todos.\n- WHEN a todo is marked complete, THE system SHALL record the completion timestamp.\n- IF a basicUser attempts to update or complete a todo they do not own, THEN THE system SHALL reject the request and display an appropriate error message.\n\n### Example Workflow (Mermaid)\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"User Selects Todo to Edit\"] --> B[\"User Modifies Title/Desc/Due\"]\n  B --> C[\"System Validates Changes\"]\n  C -->|\"Valid\"| D[\"Todo Updated\"]\n  C -->|\"Invalid Data\"| E[\"Error: Validation Failed\"]\n  D --> F[\"User Marks as Complete\"]\n  F --> G[\"Completion Time Recorded\"]\n  F --> H[\"Status: Complete\"]\n  E --> I[\"Show Validation Error\"]\n```\n\n## Deleting Todos\n\n### Narrative Flow\n\nA basicUser may remove any of their own todos. Deletion is only permitted for todos owned by the requesting user. If successful, the todo is permanently removed from the user's active list. The system prevents accidental mass deletion (e.g., limiting bulk deletion to 10 todos per request).\n\n#### EARS Requirements\n- WHEN a basicUser requests to delete a todo, THE system SHALL confirm ownership before proceeding.\n- WHEN ownership is confirmed, THE system SHALL permanently delete the todo from the user's account.\n- THE system SHALL limit deletion to a maximum of 10 todos per request to prevent accidental data loss.\n- IF a user attempts to delete a todo not owned by them, THEN THE system SHALL reject the deletion and display a clear error.\n\n### Example Workflow (Mermaid)\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"User Selects Todo(s) to Delete\"] --> B[\"System Confirms Ownership\"]\n  B -->|\"Confirmed\"| C[\"Todo(s) Deleted\"]\n  B -->|\"Not Owner\"| D[\"Error: Cannot Delete Others' Todos\"]\n  C --> E[\"Success Message\"]\n  D --> F[\"Show Error\"]\n  A --> G[\"Bulk Delete (10 max)\"]\n```\n\n## Error and Recovery Flows\n\n### Narrative Flow\n\nThroughout all operations, the system anticipates common error cases—such as invalid inputs, permission errors, exceeding quota, or backend failures—and provides clear, actionable messages. In error situations, user progress is preserved where feasible, and steps to recover are offered (e.g., retrying failed actions, receiving hints on corrections).\n\n#### EARS Requirements\n- IF an operation fails due to invalid input, THEN THE system SHALL display an error message giving specific feedback on the cause (e.g., 'Title is required', 'Due date cannot be in the past').\n- IF a user attempts unauthorized access, THEN THE system SHALL prevent the operation and advise the user of access limitations.\n- IF backend errors occur (e.g., data persistence issues), THEN THE system SHALL inform the user that the operation failed due to a technical issue and suggest trying again later. User data must not be lost due to such errors.\n- THE system SHALL allow users to retry failed actions after corrective input or a short waiting period (where relevant, such as in login failures).\n\n### Example Error and Recovery Flow (Mermaid)\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"User Tries Operation\"] --> B[\"System Error/Invalid Input\"]\n  B -->|\"Input Issue\"| C[\"Display Specific Error Message\"]\n  B -->|\"Permission Issue\"| D[\"Show Access Denied\"]\n  B -->|\"Backend Failure\"| E[\"Inform of Temporary Issue\"]\n  C --> F[\"User Corrects and Retries\"]\n  D --> G[\"User Limited; Cannot Retry\"]\n  E --> H[\"User Can Retry Later\"]\n```\n\n## Additional Notes\n- All workflows and requirements are strictly scoped to actions performed by the basicUser role as defined for this service.\n- No functions or operations allow access to, modification of, or deletion of other users’ todos.\n- All user feedback must be specific, actionable, and delivered in the context of the action the user attempted.\n- For a detailed enumeration of user permissions and constraints, see the [Authentication and Permission Requirements](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md).\n- For atomic business rules and validation requirements, refer to the [Business Rules and Constraints](./07-business-rules.md).\n- Error case handling and edge scenario guidance are elaborated in the [Error Handling and Edge Cases](./08-error-handling-and-edge-cases.md).\n- Performance expectation: All basic operations (add, update, delete, complete todos) SHALL provide user-visible feedback (confirmation or error) within 2 seconds of action, under normal operating conditions.\n- All diagrams use Mermaid syntax with double quotes for all node labels, as required by project documentation standards."},{"reason":"To outline requirements for secure data handling, user privacy, and legal compliance (even if limited for MVP), giving backend devs business mandates for user data protection and basic compliance.","filename":"05-security-and-privacy.md","documentType":"requirement","outline":["User Data Privacy Principles","Authentication Data Handling","Session Management","Legal & Compliance (MVP scope)"],"audience":"backend developers","keyQuestions":["How is user data protected?","Are there minimum privacy standards to meet?"],"detailLevel":"moderate detail","constraints":["Do not include implementation technology (e.g., OAuth, bcrypt)"],"content":"# Security and Privacy Requirements for todoList Backend\n\n## 1. User Data Privacy Principles\n\nTHE todoList service SHALL only collect personal information that is strictly necessary for core operation—specifically: user email (as a unique identifier for account creation, login, and recovery) and authentication data (for login validation and authorization of todo operations).\n\nTHE todoList service SHALL present users with clear and accessible privacy information at all relevant touchpoints—especially during registration, login, and account changes—detailing what data is collected, for what legitimate business purpose (e.g., account identification, messaging, personal todo storage), and how users’ rights are protected.\n\nWHEN a user registers an account, THE todoList service SHALL require explicit, informed user consent to collect and process personal data; this consent must be specific to the stated business purposes and revokeable at any time upon user request.\n\nWHEN a user, acting as basicUser, requests an overview or export of their stored data, THE todoList service SHALL provide a comprehensive summary, including personal identifiers (email address), registration timestamp, and all todo items created by that user (status, creation and completion timestamps, and descriptions), within 1 business day of the request.\n\nWHEN a basicUser initiates an account deletion request, THE todoList service SHALL irreversibly delete all personal user data, including authentication credentials and all associated todo items, ensuring no residual personal data persists beyond 48 hours of confirmation. Data must be purged from active records and backups, except where otherwise required for legal, regulatory, or auditing retention.\n\nTHE todoList service SHALL implement a data retention policy whereby deleted user records and todos are retained no longer than 7 days post-deletion for business audit, transactional integrity, or legal compliance requirements; upon expiration, all such data SHALL be permanently destroyed. WHERE external (e.g., law enforcement) retention orders require, THE system SHALL suspend deletion and notify the user in general terms (without disclosing investigatory specifics).\n\nTHE todoList service SHALL treat all user todo items and profile data as private and visible only to their owner, with no sharing or publication to other users unless a future business feature is enabled via explicit separate consent.\n\nWHEN a privacy policy or terms of use document is updated, THE todoList service SHALL notify all users at next login and request renewed consent for any new or materially changed data practices before further use.\n\n\n## 2. Authentication Data Handling\n\nWHEN a user completes registration, THE todoList service SHALL store authentication credentials (e.g., password or other secret) in a format that is non-recoverable (i.e., not human-readable and not decryptable by any process) to mitigate risk of unauthorized access, theft, or leakage.\n\nTHE todoList service SHALL never store or persist any plaintext password, token, or authentication secret; this includes in logs or backups.\n\nWHEN a basicUser changes their authentication data (e.g., updates password), THE todoList service SHALL immediately invalidate all other active sessions and authentication tokens associated with that user, requiring logged-out reauthentication on all affected devices. All new authentications afterwards require the updated secret.\n\nWHEN a basicUser requests to update their email address or other unique identifier, THE todoList service SHALL verify this change by confirming the action via explicit user interaction (such as confirming a verification link sent to the new address) before making the change and updating records.\n\nWHEN authentication fails—at registration, password reset, or login—THE todoList service SHALL emit only generic error responses (\"invalid credentials\"), and SHALL never disclose whether an email or account exists, to prevent enumeration or targeted attacks.\n\nIF a user fails to login with valid credentials 5 times within any rolling 10-minute period, THEN THE todoList service SHALL temporarily lock their account to new authentication attempts for 15 minutes, and SHALL display a clear message indicating temporary lockout and when access will be restored.\n\nWHEN a basicUser requests a password reset, THE todoList service SHALL provide the required reset flow strictly to the registered email address, ensuring only the account holder can initiate or complete password changes.\n\n\n## 3. Session Management\n\nWHEN a basicUser successfully authenticates, THE todoList service SHALL create a session represented by a secure token with strictly controlled lifespans: access tokens last 30 minutes, refresh tokens last 14 days. Tokens SHALL be non-predictable and associated only with the authenticating user.\n\nWHEN a session (access or refresh token) expires, THE todoList service SHALL require the basicUser to either refresh the session (using a valid refresh token) or perform full reauthentication through login. Expired, revoked, or maliciously reused tokens SHALL produce an immediate logout and prevent all further API use until a valid login is performed.\n\nWHEN a basicUser manually logs out, THE todoList service SHALL immediately invalidate all session tokens associated with that session, ensuring that no further requests with those tokens are accepted for protected business operations.\n\nWHERE concurrent or multi-device sessions are supported (at MVP, a user SHALL have the ability to manage and revoke all of their own sessions), THE todoList service SHALL provide an endpoint or workflow for users to view their current session/token list and revoke any session (immediate invalidation and device logout) at their discretion.\n\nWHEN a user performs any action affecting authentication (login, logout, token expiry, token refresh), THE todoList service SHALL provide clear, actionable user feedback (such as session status indicators, warnings about expiration or successful session termination) within 2 seconds of the user action.\n\n\n## 4. Legal & Compliance (MVP Scope)\n\nTHE todoList service SHALL maintain a publicly accessible Privacy Notice (linked from registration and available from the main application) summarizing all data processing practices, individual rights (access, correction, deletion, portability), and describing how, when, and why user data is handled in business operation.\n\nWHEN a basicUser requests account deletion, THE todoList service SHALL provide confirmation and estimated timeline (within 1 business day) and complete data deletion within 48 hours, except where a valid retention order exists. If deletion cannot be completed as promised, THE system SHALL notify the affected user with updated status and expected timeline.\n\nWHEN a basicUser requests a copy of their data (data portability), THE todoList service SHALL deliver, within 48 hours, a portable, human-readable summary of all user data held (see Data Privacy Principles for field inclusions).\n\nWHERE required by applicable law, THE todoList service SHALL maintain an audit log of staff-initiated data access (e.g., for customer support), ensuring these logs are readable only by authorized staff and not accessible to basicUser accounts. All audit entries SHALL include timestamp, reason for access, and unique identifier of the support action.\n\nTHE todoList service SHALL treat all archived or deleted user data with the same strict confidentiality, privacy, and security rules as live data, with access granted only for explicit business, audit, or legal compliance needs.\n\nTHE todoList service SHALL proactively monitor user requests for privacy-related actions (account delete, data export, consent revoke), flagging any anomalous or high-volume requests for review under business privacy policy.\n\nWHEN a breach of user data privacy occurs, THE todoList service SHALL notify affected users within 72 hours of discovery, providing information on nature of breach, data potentially affected, actions taken, and user recovery or mitigation instructions.\n\n\n## 5. Performance & Error Handling\n\nWHEN a user initiates privacy-related requests (account delete, data export, consent update), THE todoList service SHALL respond within 2 seconds either with immediate confirmation, actionable progress indicators, or explicit steps if manual review is required (e.g., legal review or audit hold).\n\nIF the system is temporarily unable to process privacy requests due to internal error (e.g., storage unavailability, legal hold), THEN THE todoList service SHALL advise the user within 2 seconds, providing the reason, expected time for remediation, and guidance on alternate resolution, escalation, or support contact.\n\nWHEN a user is subject to account lockout or temporary access restriction, THE todoList service SHALL explain the business reason (lockout due to repeated failed attempts, timing of restoration, contact for support if needed) at each further attempt to login while lockout is active.\n\nIF a session or account becomes compromised, THEN THE todoList service SHALL require reset of credentials for reactivation, log out all active sessions, and advise the user of required recovery steps and support options.\n\nWHEN audit, legal hold, or compliance review suspends a requested privacy action (like deletion), THE todoList service SHALL advise the user generally (without detail) that their request is pending legal/compliance review, and update them upon release of the hold or completion.\n\nWHEN any privacy, session, or authentication process fails or encounters errors, THE todoList service SHALL return actionable, user-friendly messages that do not expose sensitive business logic or security details.\n\n\n## 6. Comprehensive Error and Edge Case Handling\n\nWHEN a user profile, todo, or authentication action fails validation (e.g., missing/incorrect fields, invalid status transition), THE todoList service SHALL reject the action with a precise, English-language error message referencing the violated privacy or business rule, along with remedial instructions (e.g., \"Please review your password and try again\" or \"This email cannot be used\").\n\nWHEN a privacy request is in process, THE todoList service SHALL provide ongoing feedback (progress status, estimated completion time, responsible contact for support queries) and SHALL notify the basicUser on completion or if additional action is needed (such as identity confirmation or further consent clarification).\n\nWHEN an account is locked due to failed authentication, THE todoList service SHALL specify the unlock time and process for recovery (automatic restoration after wait period, or contact support if user believes lockout is incorrect).\n\nWHEN a user is subject to an audit, legal, or compliance hold that prevents deletion/data modification, THE todoList service SHALL provide notification of the hold, general reason (business, audit, regulatory), and the process for appeal or inquiry if permitted under policy.\n\nWHEN a breach, unauthorized access, or suspected privacy incident is detected, THE todoList service SHALL provide affected users with details on: nature of the event, categories of impacted information (without exposing security architecture), actions undertaken by service, and user steps for mitigation or further inquiry.\n\nWHEN privacy preferences, consents, or terms are changed, THE todoList service SHALL require user review and explicit re-acceptance at next login, blocking further authenticated use until new terms are acknowledged.\n\nWHEN a user is denied access (e.g., unauthorized API call, attempt to access another user's data), THE todoList service SHALL provide a non-ambiguous denial message, reference the applicable business rule, and avoid all technical implementation detail in its message.\n\n\n## 7. User Role and Permission Integration\n\nAll security and privacy workflows and protections outlined here pertain to the \"basicUser\" role described in the [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md). No privileged, admin, or staff user flows exist within MVP scope; all business rules apply identically to all registered users.\n\nWHEN a basicUser requests authentication, todo operation, privacy update, or account action, THE todoList service SHALL confirm request is being made on behalf of, and for, the authenticating user's own data only. Access to others’ data is never permitted under any business workflow.\n\nIF a basicUser attempts to access, modify, or act upon any resource not owned by them, THEN THE todoList service SHALL deny the attempt, return a generic permission error, and record the event for potential audit investigation.\n\nWHEN new roles or permission changes are introduced in the future, THE todoList service SHALL update all privacy, consent, and data processing policies and revisit all security mandates to ensure continuing compliance and user protection.\n\n\n## 8.

measured over a rolling 24-hour period.\n- WHERE the system experiences elevated load (periods of peak usage), THE todoList service SHALL maintain a maximum latency of 4 seconds for any individual CRUD operation performed by a basicUser.\n- WHEN a request by a basicUser exceeds the maximum allowable response time (2 seconds typical, 4 seconds peak), THE todoList service SHALL present a clear, actionable message communicating the delay and advising the user on next steps (e.g., to retry later, check network, etc.).\n- WHEN multiple CRUD operations are issued by a basicUser in rapid

Changes to due date must also follow all validation rules.\n\n## Limitations, Validation, and Boundary Rules\n\n### Content Limitations\n- THE system SHALL require that each todo item has a non-empty 'title' string. Title must be between 1 and 255 Unicode characters inclusive.\n- WHERE a description field is supported for the todo item, THE system SHALL allow descriptions up to 2,000 characters. Description is optional on creation and SHALL default to an empty string if omitted.\n- IF a user submits a todo with an empty or whitespace-only title, or a title exceeding 255 characters, THEN THE system SHALL reject the request with a clear message indicating the length violation.\n- WHEN a description is too long (over 2,000 characters), THE system SHALL reject the request and enumerate the failure in the error response.\n\n### Count and Rate Limits\n- WHERE the business requires account rate limiting, THE system SHALL restrict each user to 100 active (not-deleted) todos at any one time. Soft-delete (trash/undo) is outside MVP scope.\n- IF a user tries to create a todo when they have 100 active todos, THEN THE system SHALL deny the attempt and expressly state the business rule and current active count in the error.\n- THE system SHALL not limit the number of update or delete operations within a user's own todos.\n\n### ID and Ownership Integrity\n- THE system SHALL ensure all todo IDs are unique and unpredictable. Uniqueness is a hard business rule; non-guessability is a security best practice (e.g., UUID business requirement is only uniqueness, not specific algorithm).\n- WHEN a user tries to manipulate a todo ID that does not exist or is not owned by them, THE system SHALL respond with 'not found' for nonexistent, and with 'forbidden' for unauthorized access, both within 2 seconds and without leaking any user/todo existence metadata.\n- THE system SHALL never expose todo IDs or metadata belonging to other users. All queries (listing, direct lookup, filtered search) are scoped to the owner on every request.\n\n### Field-Specific Validations and Required Properties\n- Title: required, non-empty, 1–255 Unicode max.\n- Description: optional, 0–2,000 chars allowed, empty string if omitted.\n- Due date: optional, must be ISO date in the future when present.\n- Owner/accountId: assigned by session authentication, never by user input.\n- Status: allowed values are strictly 'open' or 'completed'; any attempt to pass unrecognized status SHALL be rejected.\n- createdAt/completedAt: server-generated in UTC, never user-modified.\n\n\n## Permission Coverage Table (User Role: basicUser)\n\n| Business Action                                    | basicUser |\n|----------------------------------------------------|:---------:|\n| Create own todos                                   |     ✅    |\n| Read (list, view) own todos                        |     ✅    |\n| Update own todos (title, description, due date)    |     ✅    |\n| Delete own todos                                   |     ✅    |\n| Change status (open/completed) for own todos       |     ✅    |\n| View/modify others' todos                          |     ❌    |\n| Share or assign todos to others                    |     ❌    |\n| Restore deleted todos (trash bin)                  |     ❌    |\n| Bypass field/data validation                       |     ❌    |\n| Bulk operate on others' data                       |     ❌    |\n\n- Every action is validated against current session user and the ownerId of the todo at business logic layer before any data is modified or returned.\n- There are no administrative override permissions in MVP.\n\n## Business Rule Diagrams\n### Ownership and Access Flow\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  U[\"User (basicUser)\"] --> C[\"Create Todo\"]\n  U --> L[\"List Todos\"]\n  U --> V[\"View Todo (by ID)\"]\n  U --> U2[\"Update Own Todo\"]\n  U --> D[\"Delete Own Todo\"]\n  V --|\"Todo NOT Owned\"| X[\"Access Denied\"]\n  U --|\"Attempt on other's todo\"| X\n```\n\n### Status Change Process\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  S[\"Submit Complete Action\"] --> T{\"Todo is open?\"}\n  T -->|\"Yes\"| C[\"Set to completed\"]\n  T -->|\"No\"| E[\"Error: Already completed\"]\n  S2[\"Submit Open Action\"] --> T2{\"Todo is completed?\"}\n  T2 -->|\"Yes\"| O[\"Set to open\"]\n  T2 -->|\"No\"| E2[\"Error: Already open\"]\n```\n\n### Due Date Validation Flow\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  D1[\"User Submits Todo with Due Date\"] --> V1{\"Due Date in Future?\"}\n  V1 -->|\"Yes\"| S1[\"Accept and Save\"]\n  V1 -->|\"No\"| E1[\"Reject: Validation Error\"]\n```\n\n### Count Limit Enforcement Flow\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  U[\"User\"] --> CL[\"Create Todo\"]\n  CL --> CQL[\"Query Active Count\"]\n  CQL --> RL{\"Active < 100?\"}\n  RL -->|\"Yes\"| A[\"Create Todo\"]\n  RL -->|\"No\"| X[\"Reject: Limit Reached\"]\n```\n\n## Error Scenarios and Enforcement\n\n- IF a user submits an invalid todo (e.g., empty title, due date in past, count exceeded), THEN THE system SHALL return error messages specifying the exact rule violated, and SHALL enumerate all failures if multiple issues are found in a single request.\n- WHEN a user tries to access, edit, or delete a todo they do not own, THE system SHALL return either forbidden or not found, as appropriate, and SHALL never expose existence of another user's todos.\n- WHEN required fields are missing or invalid on creation or update, THE system SHALL describe which fields must be corrected and may include error codes for client interpretation.\n- WHEN an invalid status is supplied, THE system SHALL reply with error clarifying allowed values ('open', 'completed').\n- WHEN an operation is attempted by an unauthenticated user, THE system SHALL reject with an explicit authentication error message.\n- WHEN repeated invalid submissions are made (e.g., brute-force or enumeration), THE system MAY rate-limit or temporarily block actions, and SHALL respond with standardized error messaging including next steps for correction or waiting period.\n\n## Edge Cases, Recovery, and User Feedback\n\n- WHEN a request is partially successful (rare in MVP, e.g., only some batch operations succeed), THE system SHALL return information about each item’s success/failure in the batch with actionable feedback per item.\n- WHEN concurrent modifications occur to a single todo (e.g., from multiple devices), THE system SHALL apply last-in-write logic and detect/update clients with current state.

Introduction\n\nRobust error handling in the todoList service is essential to ensure reliability, transparency, and user trust. All business requirements in this document are specified for the \"basicUser\" role and focus on how backend system behaviors must surface error scenarios, provide corrective guidance, and guarantee data integrity throughout the todo management process. Requirements are written in EARS format anywhere applicable for complete clarity, actionable guidance, and conformance with best practices for backend implementation readiness.\n\n## 2. Common User Error Scenarios\n\n### 2.1 Input Validation Failures\n- WHEN a basicUser submits a todo creation, update, or deletion request with missing or invalid fields, THE system SHALL reject the action with a specific error message describing the validation failure (e.g., missing title, invalid due date).\n- WHEN a basicUser submits a todo with a title longer than 255 characters, THE system SHALL reject the request and inform the user of the maximum character length.\n- WHEN a due date is specified in the past, THE system SHALL reject the operation and provide user guidance to select an allowed date.\n- WHEN a basicUser provides a due date in a format other than YYYY-MM-DD, THE system SHALL reject the request and prompt for correct formatting.\n- IF a basicUser supplies a description exceeding any established character limits (e.g., 1000 characters), THEN THE system SHALL reject the request and specify the allowed limit.\n- IF a basicUser omits required fields (title), THEN THE system SHALL itemize which fields must be included before retrying.\n\n### 2.2 Unauthorized Actions and Authentication Failures\n- IF the access token is missing, expired, or otherwise invalid, THEN THE system SHALL deny access and return a clear error indicating authentication is required; the user SHALL be directed to re-authenticate.\n- IF a basicUser attempts to access, update, or delete another user's todo item, THEN THE system SHALL return a forbidden error, with a message explaining that only the owner can manage their own todos.\n- WHEN a session expires during an operation, THE system SHALL reject the request and provide explicit instructions to log in again and retry the attempted action.\n\n### 2.3 Resource Not Found\n- WHEN a basicUser requests a todo item by an ID not associated with their own account, THE system SHALL respond with a not found error, indicating the resource does not exist or is outside the user's ownership.\n- IF a basicUser tries to update or delete a todo that is already deleted or no longer exists, THEN THE system SHALL provide a resource not found error and guidance to refresh their todo list.\n\n### 2.4 Conflict or State Errors\n- IF a basicUser attempts to mark a todo as complete that is already complete, THEN THE system SHALL reject the redundant action and indicate the current status to the user.\n- IF a basicUser attempts to mark a todo as incomplete when it is already incomplete, THEN THE system SHALL return a warning that the todo is already in the desired state.\n- WHEN multiple identical requests are sent in rapid succession (e.g., repeated delete, update), THE system SHALL reject duplicates and confirm the actual final state to the user.\n\n### 2.5 Quota Exceeded and Rate Limiting\n- WHEN a basicUser attempts to create more todos than the maximum allowed (e.g., 1000 todos), THE system SHALL reject the action and notify the user of their personal limit.\n- WHEN a basicUser exceeds allowed rate thresholds (such as too many failed login attempts or excessive requests per minute), THE system SHALL enforce temporary lockouts with user-friendly guidance on when actions can be retried.\n\n### 2.6 Malformed Requests\n- IF a basicUser submits a request with malformed payloads (e.g., missing JSON structure), THEN THE system SHALL reject the request and provide precise feedback about the structural expectation.\n\n## 3. System Error Scenarios\n\n### 3.1 Service Unavailability and Infrastructure Failures\n- IF the todoList backend or persistence store becomes unavailable, THEN THE system SHALL return a service unavailable error and advise users to retry later.\n- WHEN network timeouts, server errors, or downtime occur, THE system SHALL never leak technical details or stack traces but only inform users of a temporary technical issue.\n- WHEN a backend operation cannot complete due to infrastructure faults, THE system SHALL provide a generic message encouraging retry, without exposing sensitive information.\n\n### 3.2 Data Persistence and Consistency Issues\n- IF the database/storage service is non-responsive or a data write fails, THEN THE system SHALL return a general error and instruct the basicUser to try again or contact support if the issue persists.\n- WHEN an operation partially succeeds before failure (e.g., part of a batch update), THE system SHALL implement atomicity or rollbacks so that no partial/ambiguous data is visible to users.\n\n### 3.3 Concurrent Operations and Race Conditions\n- IF two or more update or delete requests target the same todo in near-simultaneity, THEN THE system SHALL serialize such actions; only the first successful request SHALL be honored, with subsequent requests receiving a clear message that the todo was already modified or deleted.\n- WHEN conflicts arise during simultaneous edits, THE system SHALL reject later submissions with a message to refresh and resubmit with the latest data.\n\n### 3.4 Account Suspension/Deletion Edge Cases\n- IF a basicUser account is suspended or deleted while in-session, THEN THE system SHALL immediately revoke access, expire all tokens, and provide a clear error if further actions are attempted.\n- WHEN a basicUser requests account deletion, THE system SHALL ensure that all pending actions are completed or rolled back before irrevocable erasure.\n\n### 3.5 Token Expiry During Operation\n- IF a session token expires while a multi-step API operation is underway, THEN THE system SHALL deny the attempted action, require re-authentication, and ensure no partial data changes persist.\n\n## 4. Error Messaging Principles\n\n- THE system SHALL provide error messages that are specific, actionable, and user-appropriate, referencing failed fields, operation type, and remediation steps.\n- WHERE applicable, THE system SHALL include a unique error code and a textual explanation to support user troubleshooting and support ticketing.\n- IF a user-facing error is due to their input, THEN THE system SHALL use language that enables correction and resubmission.\n- IF a backend error is encountered, THEN THE system SHALL give users a simple but definite message (e.g., “A temporary error occurred. Please try again later.”) and never expose stack traces, database diagnostics, or internal system details.\n- THE system SHALL never include personal data or internal IDs of other users in any error response.\n- WHEN errors are logged for troubleshooting, THE system SHALL guarantee logs remain server-side only and cannot be accessed by users.\n- THE system SHALL ensure that error messages are returned within 2 seconds of user action (measured from API receipt to response sent); all errors must meet this latency under normal service conditions.\n\n#### Table: Example Error Codes and Business Scenarios\n| Error Condition                       | Example Error Code    | User-Facing Guidance                       |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Validation error (missing title)      | ERR_VALIDATE_TITLE   | “Title is required.

Recovery Paths and User Guidance\n\n- FOR each user-facing error, THE system SHALL provide next steps, such as: resubmit with corrected data, re-authenticate, reduce request rate, or retry later.\n- WHEN unauthorized, forbidden, or expired session errors happen, THE system SHALL always return sufficient guidance to direct users back to authentication.\n- IF an operation is rolled back due to failure, THE system SHALL provide a confirmation to the user that no partial change has occurred, with option to retry.\n- WHEN rate-limited, THE system SHALL specify the length of lockout or wait before action can be attempted again.\n- WHEN an account becomes inactive (due to suspension or deletion), THE system SHALL provide links or references to support resources as feasible.\n- WHEN repeated errors are encountered (e.g., after multiple failed attempts), THE system SHALL recommend contacting support or provide a clear escalation path.\n- THE system SHALL ensure that in cascading failures (e.g., backend and session expire simultaneously), the most actionable and safety-focused path is presented to user (typically, re-authenticate and retry).\n\n## 6. Performance and Reliability in Error Handling\n\n- WHEN an error is detected, THE system SHALL return the error message to the user within 2 seconds of receiving the request.\n- THE system SHALL guarantee that all errors are rigorously logged in a persistent backend auditing system; these logs SHALL NOT be visible to users but are available for support and review.\n- WHEN a partially completed user operation is rolled back, THE system SHALL inform the user of the rollback, confirm no data was changed, and recommend specific corrective steps.\n- THE system SHALL provide uptime reliability for error messages at parity with core service endpoints—users MUST never receive ambiguous or absent feedback about error conditions.\n\n## 7. Edge Case Enumeration\n\n### 7.1 Boundary and Limit Conditions\n- WHEN a basicUser attempts to create more than 1000 active todos, THE system SHALL reject the request and state the current total and maximum allowed.\n- WHEN a basicUser attempts to delete all their todos, and the list is already empty, THE system SHALL simply confirm success, never treating an empty result as an error.\n- WHEN batch deletions or updates are submitted, THE system SHALL provide field-level error responses for individual failures in the batch.\n- WHEN an edit or delete request is made for a todo just deleted in another session, THE system SHALL explain the resource is no longer available.\n- WHEN a request payload exceeds documented size or field limits, THE system SHALL provide a detailed message referencing the documented constraint.\n\n### 7.2 Concurrency and Simultaneous Actions\n- IF two requests (updates/deletes) against a todo are received nearly simultaneously, THEN THE system SHALL allow only the first valid action and reject subsequent requests, referencing the actual status.\n- IF an operation happens during ongoing account deletion or token expiry, THEN THE system SHALL fail the operation, require re-authentication, assure atomicity (all-or-nothing), and inform the user of the need to retry.\n\n### 7.3 Session and Token Expiry\n- IF a session/token expires while processing a request, THEN THE system SHALL halt all modifications, return a session expiry error, and direct the user to re-login and restart the workflow.\n- WHEN a multi-step operation is interrupted by token expiry, THE system SHALL not allow partial updates and shall prompt restart after successful session renewal.\n\n### 7.4 Malformed, Oversized, or Duplicate Payloads\n- WHEN a request contains unknown, malformed, or excessive fields (e.g., field not in schema, or exceeds documented limits), THE system SHALL reject the request and clearly indicate which field or structure failed validation.\n- IF a basicUser repeatedly sends duplicate requests within a very short period (e.g., due to browser resubmission or flaky client), THEN THE system SHALL debounce or ignore repeats, confirming only the actual performed action with precise outcome.\n\n### 7.5 Account Suspension, Deletion, and Recovery\n- WHEN an account's status changes (suspension or deletion) during use, THE system SHALL immediately end all active sessions and reject further requests with a message referencing the new account status and support options.\n\n## 8. Business Rules & Validation (EARS)\n\n- WHEN required fields (e.g., title, due date) are omitted from a todo operation, THE system SHALL reject the request and list the required fields.\n- IF title or description exceed allowed lengths, THEN THE system SHALL reject with a message referencing maximum and actual lengths.\n- IF due date is absent, malformed, or in the past, THEN THE system SHALL explicitly state the allowed date range and accepted format (YYYY-MM-DD).\n- IF a basicUser attempts to access or manage todos not owned by them, THEN THE system SHALL reject the attempt and confirm scope is limited to own todos only.\n- WHEN a backend system error occurs, THE system SHALL always provide a documented error code and message, again never exposing technical details or other users’ data.\n\n## 9.

All requirements in this document are written in business terms only; technical implementation details are fully at the discretion of backend developers."},{"reason":"To describe conceptually the information lifecycle and high-level data flow for todos and users, clarifying how information moves logically through the business workflows for backend planning.","filename":"09-data-flow-and-lifecycle.md","documentType":"requirement","outline":["User Registration and Todo Creation Flow","Todo Update and Deletion Flow","Session/Data Retention (business context)"],"audience":"backend developers","keyQuestions":["What is the conceptual data movement for main features?","Are there business rules about data retention or deletion?"],"detailLevel":"moderate detail","content":"# Information Lifecycle and Data Flow for Todo List Backend\n\n## User Registration and Todo Creation Flow\n\n### Overview\nThe information lifecycle within the \"todoList\" service commences when a user completes the registration process. Every registered user is uniquely identified and is granted exclusive ownership over their own todo items throughout all business workflows. User authentication is mandatory for all todo operations. Data movement and lifecycle transitions are dictated by the following business-driven, event-based logic (all requirements in EARS format):\n\n- WHEN a new user completes registration, THE system SHALL create a unique user record, assigning ownership status that enables the registered user to manage only their own todos.\n- WHEN a user is successfully authenticated, THE system SHALL permit creation of new todos, each todo irrevocably associated with the authenticated user's unique identifier as owner.\n- WHEN an unauthenticated or expired session attempts to create or retrieve any todo, THE system SHALL deny the request and provide an actionable error message.\n\n#### Registration to First Todo Flow (Mermaid)\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"User Registration\"] --> B[\"User Record Created\"]\n  B --> C[\"User Authenticates\"]\n  C --> D[\"Create Todo Request\"]\n  D --> E[\"Todo Record Created (linked to User)\"]\n```\n\n### Data Access and Integrity\n- THE system SHALL ensure authenticated users can only list, view, add, modify, or delete their own todo items. All attempts to access or act upon others' todos are denied by design.\n- WHERE a user is not authenticated, THE system SHALL prevent all data access or modification requests related to todos.\n- WHEN a new todo is created, THE system SHALL enforce all business validation rules regarding field content, ownership, and business-defined limits.\n- IF a user attempts to supply invalid or incomplete data during todo creation (e.g., missing or empty mandatory fields, exceeding quotas, etc.), THEN THE system SHALL reject the request and return comprehensive, actionable feedback describing each input deficiency.\n\n### Ownership Assignment Rules\n- WHEN a todo is created, THE system SHALL link it unambiguously to the creator's user identifier, establishing permanent business ownership for subsequent update and delete actions.\n- THE system SHALL ensure that, post-creation, only the associated user (owner) may perform any business operation related to that todo.\n\n### Error Handling\n- IF a user attempts to perform any operation on todos without a valid session, THEN THE system SHALL return an error and prompt re-authentication within 2 seconds.\n- IF system validation fails at any step of registration or todo creation (e.g., duplication, quota exhaustion, field validation), THEN THE system SHALL enumerate each failed rule in the error response and refuse side effects.\n\n### Integration with Business Rules\n- For detailed authentication, ownership, and authorizations, refer to [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md).\n- For field validation and input rules at creation, see [Functional Requirements Document](./03-functional-requirements.md) and [Business Rules Documentation](./07-business-rules.md).\n\n---\n\n## Todo Update and Deletion Flow\n\n### Overview\nUpdating or deleting todos requires adherence to strict ownership validation and comprehensive business logic:\n\n- WHEN a user requests to update a todo, THE system SHALL authenticate the user and verify that the todo is owned by the requesting user before enabling the update.\n- WHEN a user requests to delete a todo, THE system SHALL similarly authenticate and verify ownership prior to any data mutation.\n- IF a todo is not owned by the requesting user or the user is not authenticated, THEN THE system SHALL respond with a 403 error and an explanatory business message immediately.\n- WHEN an authenticated user issues a valid update or deletion action, THE system SHALL ensure atomic, isolated changes to maintain business consistency and auditability.\n- WHEN a deletion occurs, THE system SHALL immediately remove the todo from all user-facing lists, but may retain an 'inactive' or audit state as per business retention rules.\n- WHERE a todo is deleted, but business or regulatory policy requires retention, THE system SHALL store the item in an inaccessible, non-visible state for the business-configured retention period before purge or anonymization.\n\n#### Update/Delete Sequence (Mermaid)\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  U[\"User Requests Update/Delete\"] --> A[\"Authenticate User\"]\n  A --> B[\"Verify Todo Ownership\"]\n  B -->|\"Ownership Verified\"| C[\"Proceed with Update/Delete\"]\n  B -->|\"Ownership Denied\"| D[\"Return Error to User\"]\n  C --> E[\"Persist Change or Remove Todo\"]\n  D --> F[\"User-Informed Recovery Process\"]\n```\n\n### Data Transition Table\n| Event              | Data State Transition                   | User Impact                              |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Todo Update        | Field(s) modified by owner              | Updated view; audit trail retained       |\n| Todo Delete        | Marked inactive (retention period), then purged | Immediate removal from view, audit retention (if required) |\n| Owner Not Verified | No change                               | Error shown; no data modification        |\n\n### Business Validation and Error Handling\n- WHEN an update or delete action is successful, THE system SHALL immediately reflect changes in the user's data view and historical audit.\n- IF a user attempts to update or delete a todo not found (e.g., previously deleted, never owned), THEN THE system SHALL respond with a clear 404 or 403 error, as appropriate, with guidance for correction.\n- THE system SHALL log all denied update/delete actions with user and attempted todo identifiers for business auditability.\n\n### Edge Cases\n- IF two update/delete actions are received for the same todo nearly simultaneously, THEN THE system SHALL serialize processing to allow only the first valid action to persist, rejecting subsequent conflicting operations with actionable errors.\n- IF a user's session expires during modification or removal, THEN THE system SHALL halt the operation, preserve data consistency, and prompt re-authentication before allowing retries.\n- WHEN the retention policy changes, THE system SHALL apply new retention logic only to new events; items already deleted follow the prior rule unless business mandates otherwise.\n\n### Integration with Related Business Logic\n- Business rules for ownership checks, field limits, and validation are found in [Business Rules Documentation](./07-business-rules.md).\n- Detailed error handling and edge case processes are governed by [Error Handling and Edge Case Guide](./08-error-handling-and-edge-cases.md).\n- Data privacy and retention policies link to [Security and Privacy Requirements](./05-security-and-privacy.md).\n\n---\n\n## Session/Data Retention (Business Context)\n\n### Session Lifecycle\n- WHEN a user authenticates, THE system SHALL initiate a session using a business-defined token validity period and scope.\n- WHILE the session is active, THE system SHALL permit all user-owned todo business actions, including list, create, update, delete.\n- IF a session expires, is revoked, or abandoned, THEN THE system SHALL immediately revoke access to all user-specific endpoints and require re-authentication for further actions.\n- WHEN a user logs out or issues a session revoke action, THE system SHALL terminate all session tokens and respond with immediate session expiration feedback.\n\n### Data Retention and Deletion Policies\n- THE system SHALL retain all active user and todo data for the life of the associated user account, unless specific business-driven deletion is requested.\n- WHEN a user deletes an account, THE system SHALL schedule all user and related todo data for permanent deletion after a grace period determined by business and legal requirements.\n- WHERE local, regulatory, or contractual policy requires preservation, THE system SHALL anonymize and archive user/todo data instead of direct purge, with clear business reasons logged for retention period.\n- WHEN a todo is deleted but the associated user account remains active, THE system SHALL retain the item in a non-visible, transitional state ('inactive', 'pending purge') for the minimum timeframe required, purging after the retention/appeals window closes.\n\n#### Data Lifecycle Management Table\n| Data Type     | Active State                | Deletion Trigger         | Retention Policy         | Final State                |\n|--------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|\n| User Record  | Registered, active          | Account deletion        | X days post deletion     | Purged or anonymized       |\n| Todo         | Active, linked to user      | Explicit delete/owner action | X days (business policy) | Deleted or purged          |\n\n#### Full Data Lifecycle Flow (Mermaid)\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"User Session\"\n    A[\"Login/Auth\"] --> B[\"Session Active\"]\n    B

-->|\"Retention Period Ends\"| G[\"Permanently Deleted\"]\n  end\n  B --> E\n  C -.-> E\n```\n\n### Edge Cases and Required Behaviors\n- IF a user's session expires WHILE an operation (e.g., todo create/update/delete) is in progress, THEN THE system SHALL prevent data corruption, halt the transaction, and require user re-authentication before allowing the action to persist.\n- WHEN retention requirements change due to new business or legal mandates, THE system SHALL update retention logic for all future events and inform stakeholders accordingly.\n- IF a user requests data access or deletion while items are in retention, THEN THE system SHALL honor active legal/business rules before fulfilling the user request and provide user feedback with status and timeline.\n\n### Privacy, Security, and Compliance Integration\n- THE system SHALL integrate all lifecycle-related activities with the user rights and constraints outlined in [Security and Privacy Requirements](./05-security-and-privacy.md).\n- WHEN a data export or portability action is performed, THE system SHALL ensure only data currently within the active account/ownership scope is included, omitting items pending deletion, under complaint, or legally retained.\n\n---\n\n## Policy Consistency & Cross-Document Integration\n- Ownership, permissions, and action boundaries strictly follow [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md).\n- CRUD and lifecycle rules are governed by [Functional Requirements Document](./03-functional-requirements.md) and [Business Rules Documentation](./07-business-rules.md).\n- Error responses and abnormal paths are detailed in the [Error Handling and Edge Case Guide](./08-error-handling-and-edge-cases.md).\n- Security, privacy, audits, and long-term retention requirements are clarified further in [Security and Privacy Requirements](./05-security-and-privacy.md).\n- All changes in business retention, privacy, session, and deletion logic must be reviewed for consistency across requirements documentation, and backend teams have full technical autonomy in implementing these business requirements.\n\n---\n\nAll guidance, behaviors, business constraints, and lifecycle flows specified define only the required business outcomes for the \"todoList\" backend service. Backend development teams are empowered to select and implement any technical means that fully satisfy these business-driven requirements.

These relationships are maintained across the following dimensions:\n- All user role capabilities (as defined in [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md))\n- All CRUD and business constraint rules ([Business Rules Document](./07-business-rules.md))\n- Functional, non-functional, and security/failure handling requirements (see [Functional Requirements Specification](./03-functional-requirements.md), [Non-Functional Requirements Document](./06-non-functional-requirements.md), and [Error Handling and Edge Cases Guide](./08-error-handling-and-edge-cases.md))\n\n### Expanded Example Mappings (EARS format):\n- WHEN a basicUser creates a todo, THE todoList service SHALL associate that todo uniquely with the creator and restrict all further access to this user only (links the \"Individual privacy\" objective to the \"ownership enforcement\" requirement).\n- IF a user attempts an operation (read, update, delete) on a todo not owned by them, THEN THE todoList service SHALL deny the action and provide an explicit error message to enforce role-based privacy (maps \"Privacy compliance\" to \"Access control and business rules\").\n- WHEN a user marks a todo as complete, THE todoList service SHALL update the completion timestamp and display status change immediately in user’s list (ensures task lifecycle tracking is visible and auditable).\n- WHERE an operation fails due to a backend outage or system error, THE todoList service SHALL provide a recovery flow prompting the user to retry and log the failure for business review (maps \"High user trust and error transparency\" to \"Edge case management\").\n- WHEN the system detects repeated failed login or registration attempts, THE todoList service SHALL implement account lockout and inform the user per business error response policies (links \"Security and misuse prevention\" to \"Authentication and error flows\").\n- WHERE system usage quotas (e.g., 1000 todos per user) are exceeded, THE system SHALL block excess creation and notify the user with exact messaging (links \"Data integrity and business-defined limits\" to \"Rate limiting and user guidance\").\n- WHEN new privacy legislation or internal policy requires changed data retention, THE system owner SHALL update system logic and this traceability matrix accordingly (connects \"Business compliance\" to \"Change Management\").\n\nAdditional mappings and scenario coverage must be maintained as requirements are added or changed.\n\n## Verification Approach\n\nTHE todoList project team SHALL maintain a strict bi-directional traceability, ensuring:\n- Every individual requirement is mapped to at least one documented business objective.\n- No business objective remains unsupported by implementation requirements.\n- Bidirectional mapping supports bottom-up (feature-to-business case) and top-down (business case-to-feature) validation.\n\n### Verification Process Outline\n- WHEN a new feature is proposed or requirement is updated, THE team SHALL update the matrix within two business days to map the requirement to one or more current business objectives.\n- WHEN system features are implemented, THE team SHALL validate that each implementation passes its acceptance criteria (test cases, operational checks) and records evidence for requirements verification.\n- WHEN requirements pass verification steps, THE results SHALL be logged and cross-referenced in audit records.\n- WHEN annual/quarterly project reviews occur, THE project manager SHALL review the completeness and accuracy of traceability matrix mappings with stakeholder input.\n- IF unmapped features or “orphaned” business objectives are detected, THEN THE team SHALL address gaps immediately by adjusting requirements or business objectives as needed.\n- FOR edge cases, error handling, and non-functional requirements, test cases SHALL refer to specific business objectives and require demonstration via scenario-based business validation.\n- WHERE automated regression or business-driven validation is possible (e.g., statistical review of performance logs, accessibility audits), THE results SHALL be attached to verification records.\n- All verification activities SHALL be documented in project management or tracking tools to ensure auditability.\n\n### EARS Format Example for Verification\n- WHEN a new version of the todoList service is released, THE project manager SHALL verify every change using the updated traceability matrix to confirm compliance with business goals.\n- IF requirements cannot be linked to a business objective, THEN THE team SHALL escalate for business stakeholder review before implementation continues.\n- WHEN a requirement is verified, THE outcomes SHALL be stored as permanent project evidence (test artifacts, sign-off documentation, user feedback).\n\n## Change Management Guideline\n\nRobust business rules must govern how requirements and objectives evolve while maintaining traceability:\n- WHEN requirements or business objectives change, THE project manager SHALL document the rationale, record stakeholder approvals, and update the traceability matrix, all within five business days.\n- WHEN requirements are added, changed, or deprecated, THE team SHALL validate that all related rows in the matrix are updated and at least one business objective is connected.\n- WHEN requirements or controls are removed, THE matrix SHALL ensure no unsupported business objectives remain.\n- WHEN conflicts among requirements are identified (e.g., overlapping or competing objectives), THE project manager SHALL coordinate stakeholder meetings for resolution and document outcomes and accountability.\n- FOR any audit process (internal or external), traceability evidence SHALL be provided directly from maintained audit logs and project management records.\n- All roles with responsibility for traceability (e.g., requirements engineer, project manager) SHALL track updates to requirements and business objectives as distinct, auditable events.\n- All changes affecting traceability SHALL be reviewed in annual project reviews, or as required for legal/audit compliance, using descriptive references to affected business objectives and requirement documents.\n- Stakeholders SHALL have direct access to updated traceability matrices and change rationale as a condition of project governance.\n\n## References\n- [Business Overview and Service Purpose](./01-business-overview.md)\n- [User Roles and
