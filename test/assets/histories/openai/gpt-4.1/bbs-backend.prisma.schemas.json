Business rules require categories and topics to be clearly separated. Topics reference categories, but not vice versa. Settings and analytics are structurally independent and normalized.

No tables from other domains are included. \n- Field types: primary keys are all UUID; business keys, codes, and context fields use proper types (string/int/boolean/datetime/double). No calculated/aggregated fields are present in regular tables. \n- Relationships: discussion_board_topics correctly references categories by UUID. No cross-domain FKs are needed. \n- Indexes: unique constraints for codes within scope (category for topics, board-wide for categories/settings), composite indexes for sorting and performance, no single foreign key indexes. \n- Normalization: Each table is atomic, maintains only attributes relevant to its key, and has no transitive dependencies. No denormalized data or repeating groups are present. \n- Descriptions are comprehensive, mapping requirements to business context and workflow. Timestamps support audit/change tracking as required. \n\nNo normalization, structural, or documentation issues found.
