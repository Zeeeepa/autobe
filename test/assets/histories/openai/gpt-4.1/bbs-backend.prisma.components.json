{"type":"prismaComponents","created_at":"2025-08-04T04:57:36.286Z","thinking":"Based on the requirements and documentation, the discussion board domain includes: role-separated users (admin, moderator, member, guest), boards/forums (topics, categories), threads, posts (including comments/replies), moderation actions and logs, reports on abusive content, subscriptions/notifications, permissions/role tables, and audit logs for key actions. All tables must be prefixed with 'discussion_board_' as per instruction. Each user role gets its own table (not a unified 'users' table), and role management is its own concern. Moderation logs, content reports, and subscriptions are also distinct business entities documented in the requirements. Analytics/audit logging and configuration structures are also mentioned.","review":"Reviewing the relationships and business boundaries: roles are strictly separated, as are their behaviors/actions. Posts, threads, and topics belong to the core board domain, while moderation actions, content reports, and logging constitute the moderation domain. Permissions and roles management fall under access control/administration. Notification subscriptions connect users to board activity. Admin and configuration entities (settings, analytics/auditing) are distinct but reference other domains. Category/category-topic is a linkage worth considering. I ensured no overlapping tables and all tables are pluralized, snake_case, and consistently prefixed. Table count for each domain is balanced, generally ranging from 3–10 per component, maintaining maintainability and scalability. No cross-domain circular dependencies are evident; domains are separated following DDD principles, and required business features are all represented.","decision":"Final decision: Organize the schema into five main components for clarity and maintainability: (1) Systematic (core board structure and categories), (2) Actors (distinct role tables for admin, moderator, member, guest, plus subscriptions), (3) Content (topics, threads, posts/comments, attachments), (4) Moderation (reports, moderation actions/logs, warnings/blocks), (5) Administration (role/permission configs, audit logs, system settings, analytics). All tables are plural, snake_case, and consistently prefixed with 'discussion_board_'. This organization provides clear separation of concerns, maintains domain boundaries, and aligns with the requirements for extensible, scalable system growth.","components":[{"filename":"schema-01-systematic.prisma","namespace":"Systematic","thinking":"Includes foundational structures that define the board's organizational context: categories for topics, the topics themselves, and system-wide settings for configuration. These serve as the backbone of all other user/content activity. Categories allow for board segmentation, topics are top-level discussions, and settings enable configurable boundaries/behaviors. Analytics are foundational for system-wide insights.","review":"Upon review, categories and topics are intimately tied, but system settings should stand alone, as they govern global constraints and feature toggles. Analytics tables also belong here as they provide meta-platform insights. There are no strong outbound dependencies from this component, making it a solid base layer.","rationale":"Grouping these tables together supports robust foundational configuration, reporting, and structure for the rest of the platform without domain leakage. Analytics and settings/data provide core static/slow-changing context.","tables":["discussion_board_categories","discussion_board_topics","discussion_board_settings","discussion_board_analytics"]},{"filename":"schema-02-actors.prisma","namespace":"Actors","thinking":"Each user role has distinct lifecycle and permissions, so separate tables are required for admins, moderators, members, and guests. Subscriptions (for topic/thread notifications) are also closely related to users, as are direct role grants. Separation allows for flexible role management, security, and future extension (SSO, external roles).","review":"Roles must not be collapsed into one entity per instructions and requirements. Subscriptions bridge to topics/threads and must reference user tables, staying in this domain for maintainability. Role grants and mappings are separated for flexibility and regulatory/audit purposes. Guests may simply have audit-trail footprints without authentication data.","rationale":"Actors component maintains strict domain boundaries between distinct role types, supporting scalable identity, personalized subscriptions, and auditability. Grouping all user/actor tables and their direct associations increases system clarity and aligns with access control requirements.","tables":["discussion_board_admins","discussion_board_moderators","discussion_board_members","discussion_board_guests","discussion_board_permissions","discussion_board_role_grants","discussion_board_subscriptions"]},{"filename":"schema-03-content.prisma","namespace":"Content","thinking":"Covers all core community contributions: threads, posts/comments, and attachments. Threads belong to topics, and posts (including comments/replies) belong to threads. Attachments provide support for various content types. Edit history is required for auditing and rollback. Versioning supports further features (edits, moderation).","review":"Threads and posts are in a classical parent–child relationship. Attachments may be linked to either posts/comments or threads, but typically to posts. Edit histories are tied to posts/comments, not to threads. Versioning tables support audit/logging but are best grouped here for performance and DDD clarity.","rationale":"Grouping these elements together keeps all user-submitted content manageable and enables features like inline editing, rich text, code blocks, and future extensibility for media/file attachments. It follows content life cycle flows described in user journeys.","tables":["discussion_board_threads","discussion_board_posts","discussion_board_comments","discussion_board_attachments","discussion_board_post_histories","discussion_board_comment_histories"]},{"filename":"schema-04-moderation.prisma","namespace":"Moderation","thinking":"Handles governance: moderating reports, actions taken, logs for transparency, and consequences (warnings, blocks). User reports and moderator actions are distinct but connected tables, often referencing one another. Moderation audit trails and escalations must be traceable, supporting external integration (e.g., toxicity review tools).","review":"Reports link out to posts/comments in the Content component and reference actor tables, but core moderation logic/lifecycle is internal. Actions taken (e.g., warn, block, edit, delete) need logs for traceability. Escalations (admin intervention) may also be tracked here. Follows principle of keeping governance isolated but cross-referencable.","rationale":"Consolidating moderation logic/tables maintains auditability, simplifies compliance, and supports evolving governance requirements while keeping operational complexity contained to this dedicated domain.","tables":["discussion_board_reports","discussion_board_moderation_actions","discussion_board_moderation_logs","discussion_board_warnings","discussion_board_blocks"]},{"filename":"schema-05-administration.prisma","namespace":"Administration","thinking":"Addresses system-wide administration and audit features, including role definitions, permission configuration, system notifications, and audit logs. These structures enable robust compliance, tracking, and change management for the whole application.","review":"Although role/permission mappings connect to roles and actors, the configuration tables themselves are purely administrative. Audit logs are vital for accountability and must capture all sensitive changes/operations across domains. Notifications systems support both admin and user-side alerts but are fundamentally global. SSO/external identity integrations may also live here.","rationale":"Centralizing admin configurations, notifications, and auditing supports separation of operational versus business logic, making maintenance and security much easier while enabling rapid compliance adaptation.","tables":["discussion_board_roles","discussion_board_permission_configs","discussion_board_notifications","discussion_board_audit_logs"]}],"step":0}
