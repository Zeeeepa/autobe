The vision is to provide a modern, open, and trusted space for civil and fact-based discourse, empowering participants to share perspectives, debate meaningfully, and contribute to socially significant conversations. A primary business goal is to address fragmentation and polarization in digital discourse by emphasizing source-driven, transparent, and inclusive participation, governed by explicit community standards and robust moderation mechanisms.\n\n- THE service SHALL empower informed dialogue by enabling structured, transparent, and equitable discussion environments.\n- THE service SHALL always prioritize inclusive access across diverse backgrounds, expertise levels, and geographies, to facilitate global participation.\n- THE service SHALL enforce community guidelines in all spaces to maintain civil discourse and safeguard participant well-being.\n\n## Target Audience\nPrimary user segments include:\n- Civically engaged citizens seeking to deliberate on political and economic matters\n- Students, educators, and researchers in social sciences, policy, or economics\n- Policy makers, NGO staff, and journalists conducting analysis or seeking informed views\n- Community leaders and activists pursuing collaborative approaches to public issues\n- The general public interested in nonpartisan, high-quality, and transparent debate\n\n- WHEN onboarding new users from any of these segments, THE system SHALL provide pathways to discover relevant topics and communities aligned to their interests.\n- THE system SHALL accommodate guests (read-only access), members (active participation), moderators (community standards enforcement), and admins (operations and policy management), as described in [User Roles, Authentication, and Permissions Overview](./03-user-roles-auth.md).\n\n## Key Features\n- Topic-based board and nested category organization covering core political and economic subjects\n- Post creation with contextual, structured templates and clearly surfaced community guidelines\n- Threaded comment and reply chains supporting in-depth, multi-layered discussions\n- Voting mechanisms (upvote/downvote) that enhance visibility of valued content and provide transparent community feedback\n- Robust reporting and moderation workflows to monitor and prevent misuse, ensuring fast response to flagged behavior\n- Configurable notifications and personalized activity feeds for engagement and user awareness\n- Gamification (badges, reputation, milestones) to incentivize positive, sustained participation\n- Role-based access and permissions framework; explicit separation of guest, member, moderator, admin capabilities (full structure at [User Roles, Authentication, and Permissions Overview](./03-user-roles-auth.md))\n- Privacy-centric account management and member settings, with transparent user data practices\n- Integration readiness for analytics, fact-checking, or educational partners, supporting informed and evidence-based dialogue\n\n- WHEN a user creates a post or comment, THE system SHALL validate input against content rules and enforce template completeness (see [Functional Requirements Document](./05-functional-requirements.md)).\n- WHEN moderation is required, THE system SHALL provide workflows enabling efficient escalation, decision logging, and user notification to uphold transparent governance.\n- THE permissions system SHALL guarantee that each user may only perform actions consistent with their assigned role (see [User Roles, Authentication, and Permissions Overview](./03-user-roles-auth.md)).\n\n## Business Model\n\n### Why This Service Exists\nDigital forums for political/economic discussion often fall short due to polarization, misinformation, lack of constructive moderation, and failure to surface credible voices. Most platforms do not sufficiently support rigorous, nonpartisan, well-moderated debate—resulting in poor user trust and limited appeal to professionals or informed amateurs seeking more than sensational content. polEcoBoard fills this critical gap by:\n- Establishing a high-integrity, transparent community built around clear, consistently enforced standards\n- Prioritizing evidence-based contribution through structured workflows, fact validation, and community recognition\n- Creating a trusted, differentiated engagement model for NGOs, researchers, and policy organizations seeking reliable digital forums\n- Enabling regular users to become respected participants through measurable feedback (reputation, voting, moderation)\n\n- THE existence of the service SHALL be justified by its unique enablement of trusted, structured, and constructive political/economic discourse online, with accountable moderation not found in legacy forums.\n\n### Revenue Strategy\n- Subscriptions: Premium tiers offer additional analytics, advanced badge displays, ad-free or more personalized experiences, early feature access, or exclusive event invitations.\n- Sponsored Content: Carefully screened partnerships for promoted posts, policy Q&A, or expert panels—clear labels and non-intrusive display mandatory.\n- Transactional Models: Events such as sponsored AMAs (Ask Me Anything), verified expert sessions, or content partnerships with educational consortia and NGOs.\n- B2B/Institutional Packages: NGOs or advocacy groups can host branded sub-boards, access enhanced reporting, and implement custom moderation flows via paid service agreements.\n\n- THE service revenue model SHALL avoid disruptive advertising, prioritizing member trust and integrity.\n- WHEN generating revenue through partnerships or events, THE system SHALL maintain role-based content separation so no group can influence core discussion space unfairly.\n\n### Growth Plan\n- Word-of-mouth growth driven by user reputation systems and demonstrable quality of discourse (participation, voting, and reporting activity)\n- Strategic partnerships with universities, think tanks, and research/education organizations for recruitment and community enrichment\n- High-profile collaborative events including policy debates, expert Q&A, or co-hosted sessions with influential partners\n- Continuous product evolution via regular user feedback cycles, A/B-tested feature rollouts, and transparent change logs\n- Gamification strategies encouraging both new user retention and long-term engagement via milestone recognition, streak tracking, and standing in reputation/ranking lists\n\n- WHEN onboarding new institutional partners, THE system SHALL support branded community spaces and optimized onboarding experiences to accelerate cohort engagement.\n- THE service SHALL track user, post, and event growth rates and support scaling operations, via automatic moderation tools and engaged community stewards.\n\n### Success Metrics\n- Monthly Active Users (MAU), Daily Active Users (DAU), and average session duration tracked as core growth and engagement signals\n- Engagement rates: posts, comments, and votes per active user (qualifies for business incentives or rewards)\n- Community health metrics: ratio of positive to negative reports, average report resolution time, post/comment flagging rates\n- User growth rates compared to registration churn and retention curves\n- Partnership metrics: number, diversity, and visibility of NGOs, professionals, and institutions partnering or commissioning sub-boards\n- Notable press mentions, research citations, and event participations reflecting external impact\n\n- THE platform SHALL provide tracking and reporting for all above metrics to admins and authorized partners to guide business evolution.\n\n## Market Positioning\nPlatforms addressing political/economic discussion span from broad social networks (Reddit, Quora) to specialist blogs or restricted professional bodies. polEcoBoard is set apart by:\n- Transparent and enforceable community guidelines applied consistently and visibly—no ambiguity or hidden moderation decisions\n- A business requirement for evidence-based, reasoned argument, with structural support for citing sources and integrating fact-checks (integration referenced in [Integrations and Dataflow](./09-integrations-dataflow.md))\n- Role-based workflow and governance enforced at all business and operational layers—for example, moderators act under audit, admins appoint and oversee with documented policy (clear delineation found in [User Roles, Authentication, and Permissions Overview](./03-user-roles-auth.md), with escalation logic defined in [Functional Requirements Document](./05-functional-requirements.md))\n- Dedicated, category-focused boards and sub-boards supporting nuanced, high-quality debate distinct from generalist platforms driven by ad volume or ideology\n- Integration channels for NGOs, policy-makers, and research institutes to create branded collaboration spaces, supporting institutional trust and visibility\n\n- WHEN compared to existing solutions, THE service SHALL emphasize measurable credibility, civility, and actionable insight—eschewing rapid, low-quality content churn—and providing robust audit trails and reputation signals for all participants.\n\n## Success Metrics (Recap)\n- Quantitative: active user growth (MAU, DAU), average session duration, engagement rate per user, moderation/response efficiency, number and status of partnerships\n- Qualitative: Net Promoter Score (NPS), community health self-assessment, user trust and influence within policy or academic discourse, media reputation and incident resilience\n- Platform robustness: time to flag abuse, incident response time, post-incident user retention\n\n- THE monitoring and reporting of all metrics above SHALL be made available to authorized roles in the system (see [Operations and Reporting Specification](./10-operations-reporting.md)).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[\"User Participation\"] --> B[\"Reputation Growth\"]\n    B --> C[\"Event/Partner

every process governed by explicit business logic, measurable community health outcomes, and regulatory-compliant, developer-autonomous implementation. All technical implementation details are determined by the development team; this specification defines what the service must achieve in business terms."},{"reason":"To define underlying business problems, user pain points, and key opportunities that the board addresses, grounding all requirements in user and market needs.","filename":"02-problem-definition.md","documentType":"requirement","outline":["Problem Statement","Pain Points","Opportunities for Impact","Market Gaps","User Personas"],"audience":"business stakeholders","keyQuestions":["What unmet needs or frustrations do target users face?","What evidence supports the need for this service?"],"detailLevel":"detailed specification","content":"# Problem Definition for polEcoBoard\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe digital environment for political and economic discourse is fragmented, frequently hostile, and inefficient by design and legacy assumptions. Users seeking to contribute to meaningful debate are routinely faced with platforms that encourage shallow engagement, tolerate or even incentivize uncivil behavior, and offer little to no recourse for abuse. Mainstream social spaces are typically not optimized for constructive, in-depth, or policy-centered discussion, and often lack mechanisms for fair and transparent moderation. There is a persistent, demonstrable gap for a dedicated system where users of all experience and expertise levels can take part in structured, civil, and fact-based discussion around complex policy and economics topics, with clear pathways for participation, moderation, and governance.\n\nWHILE current discourse platforms continue to prioritize scale and sensational content, THE need for evidence-driven, trustworthy, and accountable digital discussion remains unmet. WHEN individuals with deep policy knowledge or contrary views try to participate, THE system currently SHALL not surface their contributions nor protect them from coordinated attacks. WHEN incoming users attempt to navigate communities, THE system SHALL not orient them effectively, leading to disengagement and exclusion. These system-level gaps perpetuate toxicity, groupthink, and underrepresentation of diverse expertise in political and economic dialogue. The absence of robust reporting, reputation, and role-based participation tools is a critical flaw across the sector.\n\n## Pain Points\n\n- WHEN users interested in policy and economics seek substantive debate, THE available communities SHALL often present high noise and limited signal, increasing user frustration and disengagement.\n- WHEN trolling, ad hominem attacks, or personal abuse occurs, THE system SHALL rarely deliver rapid, transparent, or just moderation, causing repeated cycles of victimization and loss of trust.\n- IF a participant operates anonymously, THEN THE system SHALL lack role granularity, which allows bad actors to evade accountability while discouraging expert and invested member participation.\n- WHEN moderation is perceived as inconsistent or biased, THE system SHALL foster distrust and reduce overall engagement, often pushing marginalized or diverse voices out of discourse.\n- WHEN thoughtful, high-quality contributions are uploaded, THE system SHALL frequently allow these to be eclipsed or drowned by clickbait, sensational content, or organized brigades.\n- WHEN onboarding for new users is unclear or overwhelming—whether due to confusing navigation, opaque community rules, or weak onboarding workflows—THE system SHALL drive away potentially valuable participants before they meaningfully engage.\n- IF reporting systems or voting mechanisms are poorly designed or hard to use, THEN THE system SHALL discourage constructive feedback and flagging of negative behaviors, letting problems fester.\n- WHEN platforms fail to surface or signal reputation, THE system SHALL make it impossible for users to identify constructive contributors, experts, or recurring offenders, reducing trust in the community’s ability to self-manage.\n- IF community governance is not participatory or lacks transparency, THEN the user base SHALL feel disenfranchised and less inclined to help moderate or improve the space.\n- WHEN privacy, data protection, or advertising practices are unclear or overly intrusive, THE system SHALL drive privacy-conscious and professional users away, stunting the growth of a robust, trustworthy user base.\n- WHEN moderation tooling is inadequate, THEN the burden on community volunteers and professional staff increases, resulting in burnout, inconsistent enforcement, or turnover, further eroding trust and continuity.\n- WHEN escalation paths for severe abuse or systemic issues are not clear, THEN both members and moderators SHALL feel unsupported and at risk of exposure to harm.\n- WHEN user interface and experience are outdated or lack expected modernical notification, navigation, or participation tools, THE system SHALL make it harder for users to stay engaged and for staff to efficiently maintain community health.\n- WHEN platforms employ business models driven predominantly by advertising or virality, THE system SHALL often misalign incentives by optimizing for engagement instead of quality, thus perpetuating shallow or divisive discourse.\n\n## Opportunities for Impact\n\n- WHEN polEcoBoard enables evidence-driven, respectful, and thoughtful discussion, THE platform SHALL fulfill a critical need for high-quality political and economics communities disenfranchised by mainstream social products.\n- WHEN role-based permissions are clearly established and enforced (guest, member, moderator, admin), THE system SHALL foster user confidence and create a sense of trust and safety.\n- WHEN robust voting, reputation, and signaling mechanisms are built in, THE system SHALL consistently highlight, elevate, and circulate high-quality, expert, and constructive content.\n- WHEN complaint and reporting flows are transparent, actionable, and responsive, THE platform SHALL demonstrate accountability and engage users as participants in community health.\n- WHEN onboarding is thoughtfully designed to educate, orient, and connect new users, THE system SHALL reduce churn and foster inclusive engagement from across the ideological and experience spectrum.\n- WHEN real-time, relevant notifications and accessible moderation tools are provided, THE system SHALL keep stakeholders informed, streamline action, and reward positive engagement across roles.\n- WHEN privacy-first authentication and granular data management policies are prioritized, THE system SHALL attract professional, expert, and privacy-conscious contributors.\n- WHEN integrations (with fact-checking tools, academic indices, or external certification) are established, THE platform SHALL further differentiate itself, promote evidence-based deliberation, and counter mis/disinformation.\n- WHEN governance and policy are intentionally transparent, participatory, and communicable, THE system SHALL empower the community, drive adoption, and improve the legitimacy of both content and moderation outcomes.\n\nWHILE most platforms primarily serve guests and loosely-defined members, polEcoBoard’s model of explicit role differentiation maps responsibilities and privileges, creating clear user journeys and a pathway for invested users to take on community stewardship and eventually administrative duties.\n\n## Market Gaps\n\n- WHEN mainstream networks such as Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter prioritize limitless scale, THE resulting discourse platforms SHALL often devolve into superficial, polarized engagement at the expense of thoughtful debate and policy-informed analysis.\n- IF specialized forums or policy-focused communities exist, THEN these SHALL typically suffer from underinvestment in technical tooling, role-based access, transparency, and trust systems—failing to sustain civil or expert-driven conversations over time.\n- WHEN examining leading platforms, THE majority SHALL not offer robust role separation or reputation-based signaling; new contributors and experts compete for attention on equal footing with trolls or coordinated brigades.\n- WHEN current options provide anonymity for psychological safety but fail to enforce role accountability, THE system SHALL often create an environment ripe for abuse or coordinated disruption.\n- WHEN new market research and user surveys are analyzed, THE evidence SHALL indicate widespread dissatisfaction with both the quality of discourse and the experience of dealing with anti-social behavior, especially in contentious subject areas like politics and economics.\n- WHEN privacy, data, and advertising policies prioritize engagement or cross-promotion at the expense of protection, THE system SHALL decrease its attractiveness to sensitive contributors, policy professionals, and those seeking open but safe civic dialogue.\n- IF transparent governance and workflows for moderation, content reporting, or escalation are missing, THEN platforms SHALL be unable to win user trust or create sustained community engagement among diverse, rigorous, or underrepresented user bases.\n- WHEN adversarial actors and false information campaigns increase in volume and sophistication, THE existing options SHALL lack business logic or tooling for scalable detection, response, and community resilience—undermining trust in the entire ecosystem.\n- WHEN looking at legacy discussion boards, THE absence of features like real-time feedback, granular notification, robust reporting, and claims verification means the industry standard is out of sync with today’s user needs for accountability, speed, and user empowerment.\n- WHEN analyzing competitors, none explicitly support participatory, multi-role, transparent governance for complex domains like political discourse and economic policy, thereby missing a critical success factor for stakeholder trust and community longevity.\n\n## User Personas\n\n### Guest\n\n- Description: A non-authenticated visitor who browses debates and discussions on polEcoBoard. Seeks to gauge the quality, depth, and civility of the community before deciding to join as a member.\n- Pain Points:\n    - WHEN browsing, THE guest SHALL find it difficult to assess credibility and tone due to limited visibility of reputation/reputation signals and community norms.\n    - WHEN attempting to interact, THE system SHALL restrict engagement options, potentially making it hard for guests to understand the value of full participation.\n    - WHEN abuse or polarization is visible in public discussions, THE guest SHALL form a negative first impression, discouraging sign-up.\n    - WHEN onboarding flows or calls-to-action are unclear, THE system SHALL miss opportunities to convert guests to active members.\n- Opportunity:\n    - WHEN guests are presented with intuitive registration flows, prominent displays of community standards, and visible examples of positive engagement, THE likelihood of guest-to-member conversion SHALL rise.\n    - WHEN evidence of transparent moderation, rapid abuse handling, and trust signals is available, THE guest SHALL be more inclined to join and participate over the long term.\n\n### Member\n\n- Description: A registered user who participates in substantive debate, contributes posts and comments, votes on content, and helps surface quality discourse through reporting or other participation mechanisms on polEcoBoard.\n- Pain Points:\n    - WHEN sharing non-mainstream or specialist views, THE member SHALL fear retribution or hostile engagement from others unless robust moderation and protection are visible and trustworthy.\n    - WHEN their contributions are lost in the noise or receive less visibility than lower-quality, more sensational submissions, THE member SHALL feel discouraged from repeat participation.\n    - IF onboarding for new members omits guidance on posting etiquette, moderation policies, or voting/reporting rules, THEN THE member SHALL experience confusion or unintentional rule infractions.\n    - WHEN unclear boundaries exist for reporting, voting, or editing, THE member SHALL struggle to exercise agency in community governance or content curation.\n    - WHEN lacking meaningful reward, recognition, or impact, THE member SHALL disengage, reducing overall content quality and civility.\n- Opportunity:\n    - WHEN robust onboarding, transparent community standards, and role-based escalation paths exist, THE member SHALL feel empowered to contribute, report problems, and aspire to advanced roles like moderator.\n    - WHEN reputation systems accurately surface expertise, civility, and impact, THE member SHALL be incentivized to engage meaningfully and consistently.\n\n### Moderator\n\n- Description: A trusted community peer or staff member on polEcoBoard responsible for reviewing reports, adjudicating conflicts, removing abusive or noncompliant content, and enforcing community rules in accordance with clear policy.\n- Pain Points:\n    - WHEN faced with high volumes of reports, unclear enforcement guidelines, or inadequate tooling, THE moderator SHALL encounter high emotional labor, slow decision cycles, and risk of inconsistent action.\n    - WHEN enforcement decisions are second-guessed, lack transparency, or are overturned by admins without communication, THE moderator SHALL face backlash and stress from members, increasing attrition.\n    - WHEN moderation actions are time-consuming or lack audit trail, THE system SHALL fail to support accountability, exposing moderators to accusation of bias or arbitrary authority.\n    - WHEN moderators must operate across broad topic areas or without contextual support, THE system SHALL increase the risk of error or unfair enforcement.\n- Opportunity:\n    - WHEN empowerment tools, clear escalation paths, and transparent status logs are available, THE moderator SHALL act with consistency and confidence, leading to effective and fair outcomes.\n    - WHEN moderator decisions are supported by timely admin feedback, training, and automated alerts, THE system SHALL improve team well-being, reduce burnout, and foster long-term retention.\n\n### Admin\n\n- Description: The highest-authority system and policy administrator for polEcoBoard, charged with managing categories, configuring enforcement standards, setting up role structures, overseeing all security/compliance, and maintaining overall platform health.\n- Pain Points:\n    - WHEN manual processes are required for moderator appointment, systemic configuration, audit review, or user management, THE admin SHALL experience inefficiencies and risk of error.\n    - WHEN analytics, reporting, or audit trails are absent or inadequately detailed, THE admin SHALL be unable to ensure system policy compliance or respond proactively to issues.\n    - IF evolving business or policy needs are not quickly adaptable via configuration, THEN THE admin SHALL experience lag in enforcement, increased operational cost, or inability to meet stakeholder expectations.\n    - WHEN abusive patterns, coordinated attacks, or privacy threats go undetected, THE admin SHALL be unable to uphold trust, risking reputational and regulatory harm.\n- Opportunity:\n    - WHEN polEcoBoard enables administrative dashboards, automation of repetitive tasks, comprehensive analytics, and click-through audit trails, THE admin SHALL maintain compliance, policy agility, and a positive reputation for the platform.\n    - WHEN configuration is streamlined, transparent, and logged, THE admin SHALL reduce risk, support system longevity, and empower all roles to operate efficiently and securely.\n\n## Evidence Supporting Need for the Service\n\n- WHEN reviewing academic literature and independent surveys, THE data SHALL consistently demonstrate user dissatisfaction with the tenor, safety, and substance of current online politics and economics communities; accounts of declining engagement, harassment, and polarization are well-documented.\n- WHEN examining decline in participation rates after periods of absent or inconsistent moderation, THE effect SHALL be significant and measurable: platforms see both loss of contributor diversity and lower content quality metrics.\n- WHEN user interviews are conducted or feedback is solicited from target personas (e.g., students, professionals, community leaders), THE need for clear role structures, transparent reputation, participatory governance, and stronger protection is continually reiterated.\n- WHEN new regulations mandate enhanced privacy, transparent handling of misinformation, or timely response to abuse/incidents (such as GDPR, CCPA, and DSA), THE platform SHALL be required to adopt innovation in design and process to maintain compliance and competitive appeal.\n- WHEN comparative market and case studies are performed—analyzing competitors who failed to implement robust role systems, proper reporting, or participatory governance—THE resulting community health and retention outcomes SHALL lag far behind those seen in more advanced, user-centric offerings.\n\n---\n\npolEcoBoard’s approach, design, and business logic are explicitly and uniquely grounded in comprehensive real-world pain points and empirically documented gaps. Every subsequent business requirement, feature, workflow, and validation for polEcoBoard SHALL be informed by these realities, with a commitment to user trust, operational sustainability, and measurable positive impact."},{"reason":"To clearly describe all user roles, their permissions, and authentication requirements in business language—establishing foundation for role-based access and security.","filename":"03-user-roles-auth.md","documentType":"requirement","outline":["Authentication Flow Requirements","User Role Structure","Permission Matrix","Role Responsibilities and Limitations","Session/Token Management"],"audience":"backend developers","keyQuestions":["What roles exist and what can/can't they do?","How is authentication achieved and how are permissions validated?","How is session security maintained?"],"detailLevel":"detailed specification","constraints":["Must define JWT-based authentication with role/permission info in payload","Include permission matrix as a Markdown table"],"content":"# polEcoBoard User Roles and Authentication Requirements\n\nThe polEcoBoard service provides a community platform for high-integrity political and economic discussions.

User Onboarding and Registration\n\n### 1.1 Process Overview\n- WHEN a guest accesses the polEcoBoard platform, THE system SHALL present registration and sign-in options immediately and access to public content without interaction privileges.\n- WHEN a guest selects the registration option, THE system SHALL provide a registration form requiring a unique email address (RFC 5322-compliant and not registered), password (minimum 8 characters, including 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 digit, 1 symbol), and explicit checkbox confirming consent to terms of use and privacy policy.\n- THE system SHALL validate all registration form fields upon submission, presenting inline error messages with specific guidance for each failed rule or format (e.g., \"Password must include uppercase letter\").\n- WHEN all input is valid, THE system SHALL create an inactive member account in \"pending verification\" state.\n- WHEN registration is successful, THE system SHALL immediately send a verification email with a unique time-limited link (valid for 24 hours) to the registered email address. The email SHALL include instructions for verification, a summary of next steps, privacy information, and support contacts.\n- WHEN the user clicks the verification link within 24 hours, THE system SHALL activate the account, transition role to \"member,\" and allow login.\n- IF the verification link is expired/invalid, THEN THE system SHALL display an informative error and allow for resending a new verification email upon request, up to 3 resend attempts/day.\n- WHEN verification is completed, THE system SHALL present an onboarding guide with community values, posting/commenting rules, privacy basics, and introductory tutorial.\n- IF a guest attempts registration with an already registered email, THEN THE system SHALL display an error: \"Email already registered. Log in or reset password.\"\n- IF a guest submits invalid field values, THE system SHALL block submission until each error is corrected with actionable feedback.\n- WHEN verification is not completed within 24 hours, THEN THE system SHALL automatically deactivate the incomplete account and require full re-registration.\n- THE system SHALL support future support for federated identity registration (e.g., Google, Facebook) with validated emails, governed by privacy and consent rules outlined for native registration.\n\n### 1.2 State Transitions and Edge Scenarios\n- Guest → “Registered (pending verification)” → “Member (active)”\n- IF registration is abandoned (incomplete form, closed tab), THEN THE system SHALL not persist any private data except with explicit user consent (e.g., \"Save for later\").\n\n### 1.3 Access Control\n- WHILE in guest state, THE system SHALL prevent access to all posting, commenting, voting, reporting, or account management actions.\n\n### 1.4 Mermaid Diagram: Registration & Onboarding\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Visitor Arrives\"] --> B[\"Clicks 'Register'\"]\n  B --> C[\"Enters Email/Password/Consent\"]\n  C --> D[\"Validate Fields\"]\n  D -->|\"Valid\"| E[\"Create Pending Account\"]\n  D -->|\"Invalid\"| F[\"Show Registration Error\"]\n  E --> G[\"Send Verification Email\"]\n  G --> H[\"User Clicks Verification Link\"]\n  H --> I{\"Link Valid?\"}\n  I -->|\"Yes\"| J[\"Activate Member Account\"]\n  I -->|\"No\"| K[\"Show Error & Resend Option\"]\n  J --> L[\"Present Onboarding Guide\"]\n```\n\n## 2. Login/Logout and Session Flow\n\n### 2.1 Login\n- WHEN a member accesses the login screen, THE system SHALL require valid email and password.\n- WHEN credentials are submitted, THE system SHALL validate against all activated accounts within 2 seconds and show progress feedback.\n- IF credentials are valid, THE system SHALL issue a JWT access token (15-30 minutes) and a refresh token (7-30 days), both containing userId, role, and permission array, and redirect to the last visited or home page.\n- IF login fails, THE system SHALL display error \"Incorrect credentials\" and track failed attempt count. After 3 failures, THE system SHALL prompt password reset; after 5 within 60 minutes, THE system SHALL apply a 15-minute lockout and notify user via email.\n- IF account is not verified, THE system SHALL alert \"Account not verified\" with link to resend verification.\n\n### 2.2 Logout\n- WHEN a member, moderator, or admin performs logout, THE system SHALL invalidate all issued access tokens for the session, discard sensitive local state, and redirect to home.\n- IF a user attempts protected actions after logout, THE system SHALL redirect to login, storing requested action/route for return after authentication.\n\n### 2.3 Session Management\n- WHILE activity occurs, THE system SHALL refresh the session sliding-expiry for up to 30 minutes of inactivity.\n- WHEN 30 minutes have passed without interaction, THE system SHALL log out the user and present: \"Session expired. Please log in again.\"\n- WHEN a password is changed or account recovery is completed, THE system SHALL invalidate all prior tokens, requiring fresh login.\n\n### 2.4 JWT Security\n- THE system SHALL require JWT on every sensitive API or business operation, verify authenticity, and reject all invalid, expired, or malformed tokens with exact error codes.\n\n### 2.5 Access and Privilege Control\n- WHEN a guest tries to access member features (post, vote, comment), THE system SHALL redirect to login or registration and, upon successful sign-in, redirect to intended destination.\n- WHEN login has failed due to repeated attempts, THE system SHALL provide support contact after lockout.\n\n### 2.6 Mermaid Diagram: Login Flow\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"User Visits Login\"] --> B[\"Enter Email/Password\"]\n  B --> C[\"Verify Credentials (2s)\"]\n  C -->|\"Valid\"| D[\"Issue JWT Tokens\"]\n  C -->|\"Invalid\"| E{\"< 3 Attempts?\"}\n  E -->|\"Yes\"| F[\"Display Error\"]\n  E -->|\"No\"| G[\"Show Password Reset\"]\n  D --> H[\"Redirect to Dashboard\"]\n```\n\n## 3. Post Creation, Editing, and Management\n\n### 3.1 Business Process and Validation\n- WHEN a member creates a new post, THE system SHALL require title (5–100 chars), content (20–10,000 chars), category (predefined, visible list), and optional tags (max 5, each 3–30 alphanumeric chars).\n- THE system SHALL validate inputs and display specific error per violating field. WHEN all validation passes, THE system SHALL create post as visible and associate with member's account and timestamp.\n- WHEN a member edits own post, THE system SHALL allow edit within 24 hours; edits after 24 hours require moderator approval. Every edit SHALL be logged, and posts annotated as \"edited\" with a linked edit history visible for moderator/admin review.\n- WHEN a member deletes own post within 24 hours, THE system SHALL request explicit confirmation and warn deletion is irreversible; after 24 hours, only moderator or admin can delete.\n- WHEN moderator or admin edits/deletes any post, THE system SHALL log action to a non-editable moderation record including acting account, reason, date/time, and related post metadata.\n- THE system SHALL permit moderators/admins to pin/unpin posts (sticky at top of lists), lock/unlock posts (disallow new replies), and annotate as \"official\" where appropriate.\n- WHEN any user attempts to edit or delete another's post, THE system SHALL reject with error: \"You do not have permission to modify this content.\"\n- WHEN bulk deletion or moderation events occur (admin action), THE system SHALL issue notifications to affected users with justification.\n\n### 3.2 Edge and Error Handling\n- IF a post submission lacks required fields, THEN THE system SHALL prevent submission and indicate which are missing.\n- IF a delete operation is cancelled, THE system SHALL leave post/state unchanged.\n- IF a moderator/admin action is overturned (appeals, admin override), THE system SHALL notify all affected users and update audit logs.\n\n### 3.3 Mermaid Diagram: Post Lifecycle\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Member Actions\"\n    A[\"Create Post\"] --> B[\"Input Validation\"]\n    B -->|\"Valid\"| C[\"Preview and Submit\"]\n    B -->|\"Invalid\"| D[\"Show Validation Errors\"]\n    C --> E[\"Visible Post\"]\n    E --> F[\"Edit/Delete ≤24h\"]\n    F -->|\"Edit\"| G[\"Save Edit (+History)\"]\n    F -->|\"Delete\"| H[\"Delete Post (Confirm)\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Moderator/Admin\"\n    I[\"Edit/Delete Any Post\"] --> J[\"Log Action\"]\n    J --> K[\"Pin/Lock\"]\n  end\n```\n\n## 4. Discussion Participation (Comment, Vote, Report)\n\n### 4.1 Commenting Workflow\n- WHEN a member views a post, THE system SHALL allow commenting if the post is not locked.\n- THE system SHALL require comments: 5–1,000 characters, non-blank, and reject prohibited expressions per content policy.\n- WHEN submitted, THE system SHALL associate comment to the post, display immediately, and store in user activity log.\n- Edits/deletes to comments by commenter are allowed for 1 hour from submission, with each change logged (edit history visible to moderators/admins).\n- WHEN a moderator/admin edits/deletes a comment, THE system SHALL record reason, date, acting role, and notify comment author.\n\n### 4.2 Voting\n- WHEN a member or moderator views post/comment, THE system SHALL allow a single upvote/downvote per item; vote tally updates instantly and system prevents re-voting (\"You have already voted\").\n- Votes may be retracted/changed within 10 minutes; after which voting on that item is locked for the user.\n- IF a guest attempts to vote, THEN THE system SHALL prompt login/registration.\n- If abnormal voting detected (multiple votes from same device/IP in short span), THEN THE system SHALL automatically flag for moderation/tally correction.\n\n### 4.3 Reporting Inappropriate Content\n- WHEN member/moderator/admin views content, THE system SHALL present \"Report\" capability. Submission of report requires reason (drop-down: spam, hate, off-topic, abuse, other) and optional text.\n- Multiple reports on the same item SHALL aggregate to a single moderation queue item.\n- WHEN moderator/admin reviews report, options are: dismiss (close ticket, inform reporter), warn author, edit content, delete content, escalate to admin (with rationale logged).\n- Report outcomes are notified to reporter and offending user with template-based business explanation.\n\n### 4.4 Edge & Exception Handling\n- IF a member attempts to interact on locked/archived content, THEN THE system SHALL block and display \"No further replies/votes allowed.\"\n- IF a user attempts duplicate report on same content, THEN THE system SHALL deny and display report status.\n- WHEN a reported item is cleared, reporters are notified with resolution.\n- IF moderator abuse or repeated error in report handling is detected, escalate immediately to admin for review.\n\n### 4.5 Mermaid Diagram: Participation & Moderation\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Participation\"\n    A[\"View Post\"] --> B[\"Comment\"] --> C[\"Edit/Delete (1h)\"]\n    A --> D[\"Upvote/Downvote\"] --> E[\"Update Tally\"]\n    D --> F[\"Lock Vote (per item)\"]\n    A --> G[\"Report Content\"] --> H[\"Moderator Review Queue\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Moderation\"\n    I[\"Moderator Review\"] --> J{\"Action?\"}\n    J -->|\"Dismiss\"| K[\"Close Ticket\"]\n    J -->|\"Warn\"| L[\"Notify User\"]\n    J -->|\"Edit/Delete\"| M[\"Change+Log\"]\n    J -->|\"Escalate\"| N[\"Notify Admin\"]\n  end\n```\n\n## 5. Account Settings, Notification Preferences, and Privacy\n\n### 5.1 Profile and Settings Workflow\n- WHEN member accesses \"My Account,\" THE system SHALL permit updating: display name (uniqueness required), password (subject to registration rules), email (must verify new email before changing active address), and customize notification/alert preferences.\n- WHEN a member changes notification or privacy preferences (e.g., opt-in/out of email alerts, subscription to announcement categories, show/hide profile fields), THE system SHALL store preferences persistently and apply on next relevant business event.\n- WHEN deleting account, THE system SHALL require password re-entry, detailed warning, and per policy may anonymize/delete authored content. Affected posts/comments are annotated accordingly; deletion is irreversible after confirmation, subject to audit policy.\n\n### 5.2 Privacy and Security\n- All member profile fields are private by default except display name. Members may choose to make certain info visible; THE system SHALL enforce this preference strictly.\n- IF a user attempts profile change with invalid value or blank field, THEN THE system SHALL block operation and display corrective guidance.\n- IF account deletion requested while moderation investigations are open, deletion is blocked until completed and approval granted by moderator/admin.\n\n### 5.3 Notification\n- WHEN an event triggers a user notification (reply, moderation, report outcome, admin announcement), THE system SHALL deliver in-system notification immediately and—if user has opted-in—via email within 1 minute.\n- Notification events SHALL be stored and retrievable for 60 days.\n\n## 6. User Recovery and Password Reset\n\n### 6.1 Forgot Password Flow\n- WHEN \"Forgot Password\" is selected, THE system SHALL require user’s registered email.\n- IF email not found, display generic error (“Account not found or not verified” for privacy).\n- WHEN valid, send a reset link valid for 1 hour. Link usage requires new password (per registration policy).\n- IF link is expired/invalid/used, THEN THE system SHALL show error and offer a \"Resend Reset Link\" option (up to 3/day).\n- WHEN password is changed, all prior sessions and tokens are invalidated, requiring full login.\n- All reset attempts are logged and excessive failures (5 attempts/12 hrs) trigger account lockout and support notice.\n\n### 6.2 Account and Session Recovery\n- WHEN member cannot access account (lost email, compromised credentials), THE system SHALL provide alternate verification: moderators/admins may supply secondary contact, or members initiate manual verification via support/admin review.\n- WHEN alternate verification process is approved, THE system SHALL allow password/email reset and notify user of account status updates.\n- IF identity cannot be validated, THE system SHALL lock the account and log event for audit.\n- WHEN recovery is complete, user receives status notification.\n\n## 7. Role-Specific Privileges, Transitions, and Edge Cases\n\n### 7.1 Permission Matrix\n| Role      | Register | Post | Comment | Vote | Report | Edit/Delete Own | Moderate Others | Manage System |\n|-----------|:--------:|:----:|:-------:|:----:|:------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:-------------:|\n| guest     |    ❌     |  ❌  |   ❌    |  ❌  |   ❌   |        ❌        |       ❌        |      ❌       |\n| member    |    ✅     |  ✅  |   ✅    |  ✅  |   ✅   |      ✅<sup>1</sup>     |       ❌        |      ❌       |\n| moderator |    ✅     |  ✅  |   ✅    |  ✅  |   ✅   |      ✅<sup>1</sup>     |      ✅         |      ❌       |\n| admin     |    ✅     |  ✅  |   ✅    |  ✅  |   ✅   |      ✅<sup>1</sup>     |      ✅         |     ✅        |\n<sup>1</sup>Within allowed time window.\n\n### 7.2 Transitions and State Definitions\n- Guest can only browse public content. WHEN upgraded to member by successful registration/verification, posting, commenting, voting, and reporting are unlocked, and profile images allowed.\n- WHEN moderator role is granted (by admin action), moderation dashboard and tools are enabled for the user on next login.\n- WHEN admin role is assigned, full system/business controls and board/category configuration are unlocked.\n- IF a lesser role is demoted (e.g., moderator → member), THE system SHALL remove role-specific privileges immediately and log event.\n- WHEN a member or moderator is banned or suspended (due to violation), THE system SHALL restrict all interactive features and provide notice with reason and restoration criteria.\n\n### 7.3 Success Criteria\n- Each user/business action produces deterministic results—identical input yields identical output. Action completion/failure is always acknowledged and specific.\n- Validation error responses provide actionable, field-level feedback in plain language.\n- All EARS-appropriate requirements use formal templates.\n- All mermaid diagrams use correct double-quoted label, bracket/quote syntax, and arrow.\n- Edge cases (e.g., attempts to act outside of role, conflicting sessions, ambiguous account state) always result in deterministic, well-documented resolution.\n\n## 8.

Post Creation, Editing, and Deletion\n\n- WHEN a member initiates creation, THE system SHALL allow the member to submit a post with title (max 120 chars), body (min 10, max 10,000 chars), and optional tags (up to 5 per post).\n- IF the post title, body, or tags violate length or prohibited word lists, THEN THE system SHALL reject the post creation and return a specific validation error message.\n- WHEN a member submits a post, THE system SHALL store the submission timestamp and user identifier.\n- WHILE the submission is in progress, THE system SHALL provide feedback on acceptance or errors within 2 seconds.\n- WHEN a member is posting, THE system SHALL check for category selection; IF missing, THEN THE system SHALL block submission and prompt selection.\n- WHEN post creation succeeds, THE system SHALL redirect the user to the new post for viewing, voting, and commenting.\n- WHEN a member attempts to edit a post within 15 minutes of submission, THE system SHALL allow full editing by the post author. AFTER 15 minutes, editing is locked unless the member requests moderator intervention for corrections (typos, factual errors).\n- WHEN a moderator reviews an edit request, THE system SHALL provide the original and edit proposal for comparison. Upon approval, the post SHALL be updated and marked as \"moderator-edited\" with audit trail.\n- WHEN a member requests deletion, THE system SHALL allow deletion only within 15 minutes of submission if there are no comments. IF a post has received comments or votes, THEN THE system SHALL deny self-deletion and require moderator review.\n- WHEN a moderator or admin deletes a post, THE system SHALL flag it for archival (soft delete) and retain data for 90 days, rendering it hidden from all users except admins for compliance/audit review.\n\n## 3. Commenting and Replies\n\n- WHEN a member views a post, THE system SHALL provide an interface to comment (250 chars max per comment) or reply to existing comments, supporting a single nesting level (reply to comment, not nested threads).\n- WHEN a guest attempts to comment or reply, THEN THE system SHALL prompt for login/registration.\n- WHEN a member submits a comment, THE system SHALL check prohibited language and enforce uniqueness (no duplicate comments on same post from same user within 5 minutes).\n- WHEN a comment is successfully posted, THE system SHALL show it immediately beneath the relevant post or comment in reverse chronological order.\n- WHEN a member deletes their own comment, THE system SHALL allow deletion within 10 minutes unless the comment has replies. Moderators can delete any comment with audit logging.\n- IF comment content violates rules (prohibited words, personal attacks, spam), THEN THE system SHALL reject submission and display a contextual error.\n\n## 4. Voting Mechanism\n\n- WHEN viewing posts or comments, THE system SHALL display upvote/downvote icons and cumulative vote count to all authenticated users.\n- WHERE user role is member or higher, THE system SHALL permit voting for each post or comment once per user.\n- IF a user attempts a second vote on the same post or comment, THEN THE system SHALL display an error and prevent duplicate voting.\n- WHEN a member votes, THE system SHALL register the vote and update the visible vote tally in real time (within 1 second of action).\n- IF a guest or unauthenticated user attempts to vote, THEN THE system SHALL prompt for login/registration before accepting input.\n- WHERE a moderator or admin detects evidence of vote manipulation (multiple accounts, automated voting), THE system SHALL allow these roles to invalidate suspicious votes and annotate the affected records with investigation notes.\n\n## 5. Reporting Inappropriate Content\n\n- WHERE user role is member or higher, THE system SHALL provide a report option for all posts and comments, allowing users to specify a report reason (spam, hate speech, off-topic, other) with optional details (max 250 chars).\n- WHEN a report is submitted, THE system SHALL immediately flag the reported content and submit it for moderator review.\n- THE system SHALL limit users to a maximum of 3 active reports per day to prevent abuse of the reporting function.\n- IF a user attempts to report the same content more than once, THEN THE system SHALL refuse the action and show an explanatory message.\n- THE system SHALL display the current report status (pending, reviewed, action taken) to moderators and restrict this audit trail from regular users.\n\n## 6. Moderation Workflow\n\n- WHEN new content (posts/comments) is reported or flagged, THE system SHALL add it to a dedicated review queue accessible only to moderators and admins.\n- THE system SHALL display report details, content history, and prior moderation actions to facilitate informed decisions.\n- WHEN a moderator reviews content, THE system SHALL provide options to dismiss (no action), edit (with justification), delete (with reason), or escalate to admin for severe cases (legal, safety issues).\n- WHEN a moderation action is taken, THE system SHALL log the decision, timestamp, acting moderator, and resolution (visible to admins and the acting moderator).\n- THE system SHALL notify reporting users of the outcome when moderation is complete (action taken or dismissed).\n- THE system SHALL enforce automated escalation to admin for any user receiving more than 5 moderation actions within 1 month.\n- THE system SHALL allow moderators to suspend (temporary) or ban (permanent) users subject to admin review and audit logging.\n- THE system SHALL prohibit moderators from acting on their own posts; actions must be routed to another moderator or admin.\n\n## 7. Notifications\n\n- WHEN a member receives a reply, moderation action, or status change on their post/report, THE system SHALL deliver a notification via in-system message and optional email (users may opt out).\n- THE system SHALL allow users to configure notification preferences for types of events (reply, vote, moderation, admin announcements).\n- WHEN a notification is triggered, THE system SHALL deliver it within 2 seconds of the initiating event for in-system messages, and within 1 minute for email delivery.\n- THE system SHALL provide a persistent notification history (last 60 days) accessible to users by type and date.\n- THE system SHALL not send notification emails to guests.\n\n## 8.

Introduction and Scope\npolEcoBoard is an online platform designed to facilitate open, safe, and respectful discussions around political and economic topics. Given the nature of its subject matter and diversity of its user roles (guest, member, moderator, admin), the system's non-functional requirements are critical to ensure performance, security, scalability, privacy, and legal compliance. This document describes, in business requirements language, all non-functional standards for backend planning and implementation.\n\n## 2. Performance Expectations\n\n### Service Performance SLAs\n- WHEN a user requests any main content feed or discussion board view, THE polEcoBoard system SHALL deliver the first page of results within 1 second under normal usage conditions (up to 80% of average concurrent users).\n- WHEN a user executes a search query, THE system SHALL return results within 2 seconds for typical queries (up to 100 keywords or filters).\n- WHILE under traffic levels within engineered design limits, THE system SHALL serve 99% of API responses within 2 seconds.\n- WHERE votes or comments are submitted, THE system SHALL write and acknowledge the action within 1 second.\n- WHEN uploading text posts or comments, THE system SHALL ensure no input is lost and provide immediate confirmation.\n- IF the backend is under maintenance, THEN THE system SHALL present planned downtime notices at least 24 hours in advance for scheduled events.\n- IF any endpoint is unavailable for more than 5 seconds, THEN THE system SHALL trigger an incident response notification to admins.\n\n### Page and Action Responsiveness\n- THE system SHALL maintain a maximum end-to-end latency (user to backend to user) of 2 seconds for all standard user actions (browsing, posting, voting, reporting) during non-degraded operations.\n\n### Data Processing and Throughput\n- THE backend SHALL support ingestion of up to 100 new posts per minute and 500 new comments per minute without affecting response time SLAs.\n- THE system SHALL process voting and reporting actions in real-time with an acknowledgement delay less than 500 ms.\n\n## 3.

Availability and Reliability\n\n### Uptime Commitments\n- THE system SHALL maintain 99.95% uptime measured monthly, excluding scheduled maintenance declared 24h in advance.\n\n### Redundancy and Disaster Recovery\n- THE backend SHALL implement redundancy for all critical components so that failures in any single node do not affect user experience.\n- WHEN a component failure occurs, THE system SHALL automatically redirect traffic to healthy nodes with failover occurring in less than 10 seconds.\n- THE system SHALL recover from disaster scenarios (e.g., data center outage) with <1 hour maximum data loss and <2 hour total restoration time.\n- THE system SHALL regularly back up all user data, configuration, and audit logs at intervals not exceeding 24 hours.\n\n### Monitoring and Incident Handling\n- THE backend SHALL provide real-time health monitoring and trigger incidents to admin dashboards and on-call personnel via designated channels.\n- WHEN anomalies or SLA breaches are detected, THE system SHALL log the event and escalate to admins within 1 minute.\n\n#### Mermaid Diagram: High-Level Availability and Incident Flow\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph \"Normal Operation\"\n      A[\"User Action\"] --> B[\"Backend Processes Request\"]\n      B --> C[\"Success: Response to User\"]\n    end\n    subgraph \"Failure Handling\"\n      B --> D{\"Is Failure Detected?\"}\n      D -->|\"Yes\"| E[\"Trigger Incident Workflow\"]\n      E --> F[\"Notify Admins\"]\n      F --> G[\"Auto-Failover if Critical\"]\n      G --> B\n      D -->|\"No\"| C\n    end\n```\n\n## 5. Usability Guidelines (Backend/Process Perspective)\n\n### Backend Process Usability\n- THE system SHALL provide clear, meaningful, and localized error messages for all failed business actions (not technical traces).\n- WHEN a user's post/comment is rejected due to validation or moderation, THE system SHALL explain with actionable business reasons (e.g., \"Exceeded character limit.\", \"Topic closed for new replies.\").\n- THE backend SHALL support audit logging of critical user actions (post, comment, vote, report, moderation action), write-once immutable for compliance review.\n- IF multiple backend actions are pending (e.g., batch moderation), THEN THE system SHALL process and acknowledge each success/failure distinctly in user-facing business terms.\n\n## 6. Data Privacy and Security Requirements\n\n### Role-Based Data Access\n- WHERE guest role is in use, THE system SHALL restrict access to public data only; guests SHALL not view any member PII or non-public boards.\n- WHERE member role is authenticated, THE system SHALL ensure access to member's own account data, public content, and data of other users EXCEPT for confidential moderation/admin fields.\n- WHERE moderator/admin roles operate, THE system SHALL provide access scoped to business need, with admin viewing additional audit/configuration data.\n- THE system SHALL redact all user PII when shown to roles not authorized to see it.\n\n### Personal Data Handling and Retention\n- THE system SHALL store all account and activity data encrypted at rest and in transit.\n- WHERE user requests deletion or account removal, THE system SHALL purge all personal information within 30 days and confirm deletion to the user.\n- WHERE account deletion is mandated by law (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), THE system SHALL provide audit logs confirming completion.\n- THE system SHALL only retain logs and data for business-justified retention periods and destroy expired data.\n\n### Sensitive Data Protection\n- THE system SHALL hash and salt all passwords using industry best practices.\n- THE system SHALL never store or log raw passwords, authentication secrets, or security tokens.\n- ALL API or external service integrations SHALL use secure channels (HTTPS/TLS) and require authentication.\n\n### Data Breach Detection and Response\n- WHEN a suspected data breach is detected, THE system SHALL trigger breach response procedures and notify admins within 30 minutes.\n- THE system SHALL preserve forensic data and incident logs for investigation.\n- WHERE required by law, THE system SHALL notify affected users and authorities within mandatory time limits.\n\n## 7. Compliance (Legal and Policy)\n\n### Regulatory Coverage\n- WHERE the service operates in regulatory jurisdictions (e.g., EU, US, KR), THE system SHALL comply with all local data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, PIPA).\n- THE backend SHALL implement age-gating and consent mechanisms aligned with relevant laws for minors and sensitive data.\n- THE system SHALL provide data subject access request (DSAR) features for all users, allowing them to download/account/delete personal data.\n\n### Content and Moderation Compliance\n- WHERE content takedown is required by law or court order, THE system SHALL remove such content within 24 hours and log the action for audit.\n- THE backend SHALL enforce retention/deletion policies for all user-generated content per applicable law and board policy.\n- WHERE abusive/illegal content is detected, THE system SHALL mark and restrict visibility pending moderation, store audit trails for a minimum of 2 years, and cooperate with authorities when legally binding requests are received.\n\n## 8.

Closing Notes on Non-Functional Readiness\nThe above business requirements define the minimum acceptable service levels, security commitments, user privacy standards, and compliance obligations for polEcoBoard. These non-functional provisions are essential for trustworthy multi-role operation, sensitive content handling, and robust jurisdictional compliance. Backend developers must use these requirements as authoritative constraints for all design and operational decisions."},{"reason":"To capture user scenarios including normal, alternative, and exception flows (successful post, abuse reporting, failed validation, etc.), clarifying expected system behaviors.","filename":"07-user-scenarios.md","documentType":"user-story","outline":["Primary Use Scenarios","Alternative/Edge Case Flows","Error and Recovery Paths","Role-based Experiences"],"audience":"backend developers","keyQuestions":["How should the system behave in each business scenario?","What should happen when users make mistakes or violate rules?"],"detailLevel":"detailed specification","content":"# User Scenario Requirements Analysis Report for polEcoBoard\n\n## Introduction\nPolitical and economic discussions on the polEcoBoard platform require clear, testable, and role-based requirements for system behavior. All scenarios—regular, alternate, edge, and exception—are exhaustively modeled for every user role (guest, member, moderator, admin) using EARS-compliant syntax and explicit business language. Expectations for authentication, session management, error recovery, permission enforcement, audit trails, and performance are described so that backend developers can implement every business need directly from this scenario analysis.\n\n## Primary Use Scenarios\n\n### 1. Board, Category, and Post Viewing\n- WHEN a guest accesses the board homepage, THE system SHALL instantly display an up-to-date list of public categories and the 20 most recent posts ordered by latest activity.\n- WHERE a member is authenticated, THE system SHALL additionally highlight threads the member has posted in or is following within all visible categories.\n- WHERE any user (guest or member) selects a board category, THE system SHALL present all active posts in that category ranked by most recent reply within 1 second.\n- WHEN a user views a post, THE system SHALL present the full post content, metadata (author, timestamp, votes, view count), and all visible first-level comments ordered newest-first; loading MUST complete within 1 second for 95% of requests.\n- IF a post or category has been restricted or archived, THEN THE system SHALL display a clear status explaining visibility limitation.\n\n### 2. Post Creation and Drafting (Member)\n- WHEN a member selects \"New Post\", THE system SHALL present all available categories, required post fields (title, content), and optional tag fields (max 5 tags, unique, 3-30 chars each).\n- WHEN post title is entered, THE system SHALL validate length (10–100 chars), allow only permitted characters, and block prohibited terms.\n- WHEN submission is attempted, THE system SHALL verify that all required fields are present and within business validation constraints; missing/invalid entries SHALL be immediately identified and the user notified with corrective guidance.\n- WHEN validation passes, THE system SHALL create the post, associate it to the member, log creation with timestamp, and display confirmation plus a view of the new post.\n- WHILE a post is in draft, THE system SHALL allow editing/discarding by the author; drafts are autosaved every 30 seconds and persist for 7 days unless published or deleted.\n- IF a member is muted, suspended, or banned, THEN THE system SHALL block post submission and display specific restriction and duration with escalation link to request admin/mod review.\n- WHEN a post is created, THE system SHALL update board/category lists in real time and, where moderation is required, notify appropriate moderators within 3 seconds.\n\n### 3. Commenting and Replies (Member)\n- WHEN a member views an active post, THE system SHALL show the comment form with input length restrictions (5–1,000 chars; no prohibited language; 1,000 unicode chars max).\n- WHEN submitting a comment, THE system SHALL validate user status, content, duplication (no same user duplicate comments on same post within 10 minutes), and input restrictions.\n- IF validation fails, THEN THE system SHALL reject and present a highlighted explanation of every business rule violated.\n- WHEN successful, THE system SHALL store the comment, link it to post/member, increment comment count, and notify post author if notification preferences permit.\n- WHERE a comment was made by a member, edit/delete are allowed for 15 minutes post-submission, tracked with full audit log; edits after 15 minutes (or to comments with replies) REQUIRE moderator review and explicit justification.\n\n### 4. Voting Interactions\n- WHEN a member views posts or comments, THE system SHALL display voting icons; IF the user is the author, voting icon is disabled.\n- WHEN a vote is initiated, THE system SHALL validate that the user has not previously voted and is eligible (not suspended/banned, within daily quota of votes).\n- WHEN accepted, THE system SHALL record the vote, update the tally instantly, and prevent further voting by this user on the same item within 24 hours.\n- IF duplicate voting or voting on own content is attempted, THEN THE system SHALL reject with an explanatory error and log occurrence.\n- IF all voting quotas are exhausted for the day (default: 200 per member), THEN THE system SHALL block further votes and prompt user.\n\n### 5. Reporting Inappropriate Content\n- WHEN a member clicks \"Report\" on a post/comment, THE system SHALL provide a required reason dropdown (configured by admin), and allow up to 400 characters of free-text description.\n- WHEN report is submitted, THE system SHALL validate the submission (reason present, description valid), store the report, notify the moderator team immediately, and prevent further reports of the same item by the submitting member.\n- IF content is already under review or actioned, THEN THE system SHALL inform reporting user of current case status.\n- IF a member uses the report function excessively (more than 10 in 24 hours or repeated invalid reports), THEN THE system SHALL suspend reporting rights and notify moderators with an audit trigger.\n\n### 6. Moderation Workflow (Moderator)\n- WHEN a moderator logs in, THE system SHALL show a dashboard with pending reports, flagged content, recent moderation actions, and assigned categories.\n- WHEN reviewing, THE system SHALL present content summary, aggregated report reasons, user history, prior decisions, available actions (dismiss, edit, remove, warn, suspend, escalate).\n- WHEN an action is taken, THE system SHALL enforce business/process permissions, log the rationale, update content/audit records, and notify the affected user (member or moderator).\n- IF the action is outside moderator authority (e.g., permanent bans, core settings), THEN THE system SHALL block and optionally alert admin.\n- WHERE a moderator is uncertain or polarity of decisions is high, escalation to admin SHALL be available with summarized case package.\n- WHERE a moderator attempts to alter own prior actions, dual review/approval by another moderator is required.\n\n### 7. Administrative Management (Admin)\n- WHEN an admin accesses the admin panel, THE system SHALL allow review/configuration of: user accounts; board/category structures; moderation policy/rules; analytical and audit logs; and moderator assignments.\n- WHEN appointing/removing moderators, THE system SHALL require dual confirmation, log event, and notify both the promoted/demoted user and current moderators.\n- WHEN reviewing escalated/moderation cases, THE system SHALL provide override authority and require specific justification for all critical/irreversible actions.\n- WHEN changing policy/roles/category structures, THE system SHALL log before/after, require action description, and alert all potentially affected users/roles.\n\n## Alternative and Edge Case Flows\n\n### 1. Validation, Limits, and Permissions\n- IF any post or comment includes prohibited language, exceeds min/max length, lacks required fields, or breaches uniqueness, THEN THE system SHALL reject input, explicitly indicate rules breached, and allow user to correct and resubmit instantly.\n- IF a user’s session token, JWT, or authentication is missing, expired, or tampered, THEN THE system SHALL prompt for login, preserve in-progress data for up to 10 minutes, and advise the user how to recover unfinished work.\n- IF draft is corrupted/lost during save, THEN THE system SHALL prompt user to re-edit or recover from the last autosave copy.\n\n### 2. Role Transitions, Restrictions, and Escalations\n- IF a member is suspended, THEN THE system SHALL immediately restrict posting, commenting, voting, reporting, and provide banner alerts explaining status, reason, and duration; links to appeal SHALL be prominently displayed.\n- IF moderator error occurs (e.g., action taken without required evidence, outside role, or with insufficient review), THEN THE system SHALL require admin confirmation before action takes effect and send alerts to operational admins.\n- IF a moderator attempts to alter user roles or board configurations, THEN THE system SHALL deny and log all attempts and trigger admin notification if repeated.\n- IF role transitions occur due to system integration, ban appeal, or admin override, prior and new permissions SHALL take effect on next issued session/JWT, and session log SHALL record the event.\n\n### 3. Voting/Reporting Edge Cases\n- IF a member attempts to vote after the target content has been archived, deleted, or locked, THEN THE system SHALL reject the action and display a historical state notice.\n- IF a member attempts to exceed allowed upvote/downvote counts per day (default 200), THEN THE system SHALL block and clearly explain the quota policy.\n- IF a user reports the same content multiple times, or the maximum report quota is reached, THEN THE system SHALL restrict new reports, provide feedback on quota status, and surface outstanding open cases in user dashboard.\n\n### 4. Moderator/Admin Escalation & Emergency Action\n- IF a moderator faces repeated, ambiguous, or high-impact moderation (e.g., multiple escalations, suspected coordinated abuse), THEN THE system SHALL facilitate escalation workflows, package cases with evidence for admin review, and require at least two admin confirmations for irreversible or highly impactful actions (e.g., permanent bans, mass deletions).\n- IF multiple moderator abuses or extraordinary admin actions are detected within a short interval (system default: 1 hour), THEN THE system SHALL trigger internal audit alerts, temporarily suspend automated processing, and require system audit log review and formal completion of review before resuming normal moderator/admin system operations.\n\n### 5. Automated Safeguards for System Integrity\n- WHEN error rates spike or backend slowdowns impact user actions beyond performance thresholds, THE system SHALL display status banners, initiate auto-retry for failed submissions, save in-progress data, and redirect users to a status/help page if necessary.\n\n## Error and Recovery Paths\n\n### 1. Authentication Errors\n- IF a guest/member attempts to access or perform actions not permitted by their role, THEN THE system SHALL deny access, present a business-friendly error message, and provide the authorized path for next steps (e.g., \"Please log in\" or \"Admin access required\").\n- IF JWT/session token is invalid, expired, or suspicious, THEN THE system SHALL require immediate re-authentication and record an audit log event with user and IP.\n- IF account/password reset is initiated but the token is outdated or compromised, THEN THE system SHALL deny access, prompt secure account recovery, and invalidate associated tokens.\n\n### 2. Submission and Network Failures\n- IF post/comment/report/moderation submission fails due to server/network errors, THEN THE system SHALL save unsent data locally (where allowed), inform the user of failure, and provide options to retry or discard.\n- IF confirmation of critical actions (deletion, ban, configuration change) does not reach user within 3 seconds, THE system SHALL auto-retry twice and inform the user of pending status with warnings against repeat submissions.\n- IF submission is irrecoverable, THE system SHALL surface error codes and contact/help options, and ensure in-progress data is preserved for at least 10 minutes for user retrieval/retry.\n\n### 3. Data Consistency and Integrity\n- IF any action attempts to reference stale/deleted/changed resources (e.g., already deleted post, moved/invalid board/category), THEN THE system SHALL provide user with a detailed error and a link to board/category home.\n- WHEN backend detects content inconsistencies, THE system SHALL display a global alert for users in affected flows, restrict further input, and trigger admin system diagnostics and incident reporting.\n\n### 4. System-wide Exception Paths\n- IF multiple errors/uncaught exceptions occur rapidly for a single user or session (threshold: 3 or more in 60 seconds), THEN THE system SHALL lock input, display a \"Service temporarily limited\" warning, and activate internal error logging and rollback/retry protocols.\n- IF scheduled maintenance is ongoing, or an internal service is degraded, THEN THE system SHALL display banners, block affected business features/business logic rolls as required, and log configuration for compliance traceability.\n\n## Role-Based Experiences and Permissions\n\n### Guest\n- CAN view all public boards/categories/posts\n- IF attempting to post, comment, vote, or report, THEN THE system SHALL prompt for registration/login, block action, and highlight member benefits.\n- CAN register as a member; registration flows override viewing if initiated.\n\n### Member\n- CAN create, edit (with limits), and delete (with limits) own posts/comments; cannot modify others' content.\n- CAN vote, comment, report, as per quota and business validation.\n- CANNOT perform moderation, view sensitive moderation/audit data, or access admin functions.\n\n### Moderator\n- Inherits all member rights plus: CAN access dashboard for pending reports/flagged content; CAN take moderation action in authorized categories; CAN warn, suspend, remove offending content, view and add to audit logs; CANNOT change admin configurations, appoint others, or bypass dual approvals for key actions.\n\n### Admin\n- All system privileges: CAN manage users, roles, boards, moderation policy, global bans/suspensions, analytics/audits; CAN override all moderation actions, but irreversible actions REQUIRE dual confirmation and reason.\n\n| Role      | View | Post | Comment | Vote | Report | Moderate | Admin Ops |\n|-----------|------|------|---------|------|--------|----------|-----------|\n| Guest     | ✅   | ❌   | ❌      | ❌   | ❌     | ❌       | ❌        |\n| Member    | ✅   | ✅   | ✅      | ✅   | ✅     | ❌       | ❌        |\n| Moderator | ✅   | ✅   | ✅      | ✅   | ✅     | ✅       | ❌        |\n| Admin     | ✅   | ✅   | ✅      | ✅   | ✅     | ✅       | ✅        |\n\n## Response Time and Performance Requirements\n- THE system SHALL serve homepage, board, and post view screens within 1 second 95% of the time; all post/comment/report submissions SHALL respond in under 2 seconds under normal load.\n- IF any confirmation does not reach user within 2 seconds for regular actions or 3 seconds for admin/mod actions, THEN THE system SHALL display a temporary status warning and auto-retry.\n- Critical moderation/admin changes SHALL propagate system-wide (authorization, permissions, session invalidation) within 30 seconds.\n\n## Scenario Flow Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph \"Posting and Moderation Flow\"\n        A[\"Create Post\"] --> B[\"Validate Post Input\"]\n        B -->|\"Valid\"| C[\"Save Post\"]\n        C --> D[\"Update Board & Notify Moderators\"]\n        B -->|\"Invalid\"| E[\"Show Error & Allow Edit\"]\n        D --> F[\"Moderator Review\"]\n        F -->|\"Approve\"| G[\"Post Visible to All\"]\n        F -->|\"Edit/Remove\"| H[\"Notify Author, Log Action\"]\n        F -->|\"Escalate\"| I[\"Admin Escalation\"]\n    end\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n- THE system SHALL fulfill all above scenarios and requirements in business terms, handle normal, alternative, edge, and error cases as specified, and provide complete audit trails/logging for each permissioned/sensitive action, ensuring testability and implementation-readiness for backend.\n\n## End of Document\n"},{"reason":"To define core business rules, validation rules, and constraints that govern participation, content standards, and moderation, with examples.","filename":"08-business-rules.md","documentType":"requirement","outline":["Content Validation Rules (Post/Comment Limits, Language)","Participation Rules","Moderation and Escalation Rules","Content Visibility and Retention","Examples and Edge Cases"],"audience":"backend developers","keyQuestions":["What constraints must all user-generated content meet?","How are moderation actions governed and enforced?"],"detailLevel":"detailed specification","content":"# Business Rules and Validation Requirements for polEcoBoard\n\n## 1.

IF an unsupported language is detected, THEN THE system SHALL reject and inform the user of supported options.\n- IF submitted content (post or comment) is blank or contains only whitespace, THEN THE system SHALL reject submission with a specific error code and message.\n- WHEN a post or comment is received, THE system SHALL sanitize the content to remove prohibited HTML, scripts, and unsupported markup, and SHALL escape any potentially unsafe characters.\n- WHEN a user includes code snippets in their post or comment, THE system SHALL allow only supported syntax-highlighting tags in pre-defined safe formats; all other embedded code SHALL be rejected or neutralized.\n\n### Attachment Rules\n- WHEN a user adds attachments to a post, THE system SHALL verify that only permitted file types (jpeg, png, gif, pdf, docx) are included and SHALL limit the total number of attachments to 3 per post, with a strict maximum file size of 10MB per file and a total of 20MB per post.\n- IF an unsupported file type is uploaded or a file is oversized, THEN THE system SHALL reject the attached file(s) and inform the user about the violation in clear business language.\n- WHEN an attachment is rejected, THE system SHALL provide a specific reason, supporting affected users with actionable guidance for correction.\n- WHEN a post is deleted, THE system SHALL schedule all associated attachments for deletion according to content retention rules.\n\n### Prohibited Content and Expression\n- IF a post or comment contains hate speech, personal attacks, explicit or veiled threats, discriminatory/inflammatory language, doxing, advertising/spam, or references to off-platform illegal activity, THEN THE system SHALL block content submission, provide a direct message specifying policy breach, and log the violation for moderator review.\n- WHEN a user attempts to submit content flagged as prohibited, THE system SHALL capture an audit event (timestamp, user ID, partial content or hash as privacy allows).\n- WHERE a pattern of policy-violating attempts (3 or more in 24 hours) is detected, THE system SHALL escalate for automated or manual review and apply progressive sanctions.\n\n### Language Moderation and User Protection\n- THE system SHALL maintain a living blacklist of prohibited words/phrases (including but not limited to profanity, slurs, and targeted abuse), updatable by moderators and admins.\n- IF a user submits content matching blacklist terms, THEN THE system SHALL reject the submission with an immediate explanation specifying the category of violation (without echoing term itself).\n- WHERE repeated rejections for blacklist violations exceed three occurrences in a rolling 24-hour window, THE system SHALL impose an automated posting cooldown (30 minutes) and notify the user of the sanction, including appeal instructions.\n- WHEN automated filters catch borderline or context-dependent content (e.g., potentially harassing but ambiguous phrasing), THE system SHALL flag the item for moderation review and limit public visibility until resolved.\n\n### Validation Error Handling\n- WHEN a submission fails validation (length, blank, prohibited terms, file type/size), THE system SHALL return a detailed error message with corrective instructions, maintain the unsaved user entry (so user does not lose work), and allow retry after correction.\n- IF validation fails repeatedly for the same cause (e.g., reusing excess length), THEN THE system SHALL provide progressively clearer, more actionable feedback and, after 5 failed attempts, recommend resource links or community guidelines.\n\n## 2. Participation Rules\n\n### Role-based Content Contribution\n- WHERE user has the guest role, THE system SHALL strictly prohibit creation, editing, or deletion of posts/comments and display a prompt to register/login.\n- WHERE user has the member role, THE system SHALL permit posts, comments, and votes on eligible boards/categories. WHEN a member creates content, THE system SHALL attribute authorship and timestamp, and enforce all content rules at submission.\n- WHEN a member edits or deletes own posts/comments, THE system SHALL allow this for up to 30 minutes after submission or until the first reply, vote, or report (whichever comes first). IF this period has expired or content has received interaction, THEN THE system SHALL block further edits/deletions and notify the member, suggesting escalation to moderators if legitimate corrections are needed.\n- WHERE moderator or admin role is present, THE system SHALL allow editing/deletion of any content as per moderation workflow, with mandatory audit logging and notification to the original author.\n- WHEN editing occurs, THE system SHALL create and securely store an edit history, available to admins for audit trail purposes.\n\n### Voting Rules\n- WHERE user is a member, moderator, or admin, THE system SHALL allow one upvote or downvote per post or comment per user. IF duplicate voting is attempted, THEN THE system SHALL reject and inform the user why.\n- Members and above SHALL not be able to vote on their own content. IF attempted, THEN THE system SHALL reject with a clear error.\n- Members can retract or change their vote within 10 minutes of casting the initial vote; after this, votes are locked. Changing votes is audit-logged for moderators.\n- Voting results (counts, ratios) are visible to all users, but voting identities are confidential except to admins for audit or abuse tracing.\n\n### Reporting and Appeal\n- WHERE user is a member or higher, THE system SHALL enable reporting of any post or comment for abuse, with mandatory functional reason (dropdown from report types: spam, hate speech, off-topic, privacy, other) and optional, bounded free-text field (max 500 chars).\n- WHEN a report is submitted, THE system SHALL generate a unique case, maintain reporter anonymity (except to admins), and set initial status to pending review.\n- Guests attempting to report are blocked and instructed to register or login.\n- A user may only report a given content item once; duplicate or frivolous reporting attempts are rejected.\n- IF a user files excessive invalid reports (more than 5 rejected complaints within 7 days), THEN THE system SHALL flag for possible sanction (report function suspension), reviewed by moderators.\n\n### Participation Limitations and Sanctions\n- WHEN repeated content policy or reporting abuse occurs (by member), THE system SHALL escalate consequences: warning, posting privilege temporary suspension (1–14 days), and if severe, permanent account or IP ban (subject to admin review).\n- Account bans must be defensible with audit trail and are subject to appeal as a core user right.\n- WHEN appealed, THE system SHALL record all actions, communications, and case material for compliance, transparency, and reporting to the user.\n- IF a sanctioned user attempts to circumvent measures (e.g., new account, proxy use), THEN THE system SHALL implement and log adaptive response mechanisms (IP/device matching, further sanctions, admin notification).\n\n## 3. Moderation and Escalation Rules\n\n### Moderator Responsibilities\n- WHERE user has moderator role, THE system SHALL grant powers to view reported/flagged content and all associated prior moderation events within assigned categories.\n- WHEN content is reported, flagged, or shows automated risk triggers, THE system SHALL move it to a review queue, visible to all eligible moderators (with timestamp, content snapshot, report details, and contributor/user audit info).\n- WHEN a moderator takes action (edit, removal, warning, escalation, close as NFA), THE system SHALL prompt for mandatory contextual reason and store the action, associated metadata, and time in an immutable audit log.\n- Content review by moderators must occur within 12 hours of staging or sooner if business or compliance rules require; breach of SLA triggers a system escalation to admins.\n- Moderators can restrict participation, lock threads, hide posts from public view, or anonymize content as needed.\n- Complex/escalated violations (severe threats, legal issues, coordinated abuse, policy gray area) SHALL be referred to admin with all evidence and recommended disposition attached.\n\n### Admin Authority and Escalation\n- WHERE user has admin role, THE system SHALL grant unrestricted control over moderation review, action, audit access, and all appeal/case logs.\n- Admin can override moderator decisions, but all override events are logged with rationale and must be visible to oversight functions.\n- WHEN a user (or associated account/IP) accumulates 5 or more valid reports or 3+ moderator actions within 30 days, THE system SHALL automatically flag account for admin review, generate a risk assessment case, and restrict certain privileges pending review.\n- IP/Device-based circumvention attempts (linked to sanctioned user) are detected, correlated, and escalated to admin for advanced action.\n\n### Enforcement Actions\n- WHERE content is found in violation, THE system SHALL permit removal, edit, hiding, locking, or anonymization as contextually appropriate. Severity, context, and user history determine which actions are available and require manual justification.\n- Multiple levels of sanction are supported: warning, timed suspension (from 1 to 30 days), permanent ban. Members must be notified with reasons, duration, and appeal instructions.\n- WHEN law or public safety is involved (e.g., imminent threat, evidence preservation), THE system SHALL flag and restrict content, notify admin immediately, and trigger a legal hold on account and associated material.\n\n### Auditability and Tracking\n- ALL moderator and admin actions affecting member participation/content SHALL be time-stamped, attributed to acting staff, and visible in an audit trail accessible to authorized roles only.\n- THE system SHALL maintain and display a compliance dashboard for moderators and admins showing time-to-resolution, reports per moderator, reversal rates, and outstanding escalation cases.\n- Users must be able, via account dashboard, to view (in summary) the status of reports made, sanctions on their account, and the right to request explanation.\n\n## 4. Content Visibility and Retention\n\n### Visibility Rules\n- Publicly visible content must meet all business and moderation standards, with real-time updates to reflect any status change (flagged, hidden, locked, deleted).\n- WHERE content is flagged for review, THE system SHALL remove visibility from guest and member views (except author), and include banners indicating review status to the author.\n- Removed or deleted content is immediately excluded from public and member (non-author) views, but remains accessible to moderators and admins for 60 days.\n- Locked content is read-only and cannot receive new interactions; all users see a clear indication of lock reason/status.\n- WHEN content is resolved (reviewed and deemed permissible or impermissible), THE system SHALL restore/hide with persistent notice as required by policy.\n\n### Retention and Purge Policy\n- Soft deleted content (via self-delete or moderator/admin removal) is maintained in system for minimum 60 days for audit and compliance before permanent purge, except when legal hold is applied.\n- Members may request removal of authored content; request triggers review and, if approved, applies redaction policy (content replaced with marker, details retained for audit).\n- Admins can place legal or investigation hold on deleted content, preventing purge until external release/auth approval.\n- All scheduled purges are logged and subject to reversal pending admin action.\n\n### User Requests and Data Subject Rights\n- WHEN a user requests compliance deletion under law (e.g., GDPR/CCPA), THE system SHALL expedite removal of all personal and authored content, with audit logged.\n- THE system SHALL provide summary of removed vs. retained (audit) data to the requesting party.\n\n### Special Content Cases\n- Attachments and embedded media follow the same visibility and retention guidelines as textual content.\n- External references/links may be anonymized or redacted upon review where policy or law requires.\n\n## 5. Examples and Edge Cases\n\n### Example: Post Submission with Excessive Length\n- WHEN a member submits a post exceeding 5,000 characters, THE system SHALL reject it, display a precise error citing the length limit, and allow trimming/resubmission.\n\n### Example: Comment with Forbidden Word\n- WHEN a member posts a comment containing a blacklisted term, THE system SHALL block submission, display the violation category (e.g., hate speech, profanity), and highlight user options (edit, cancel, appeal if applicable); repeated offenses trigger cooldown automatically.\n\n### Example: Multiple Attachment Violation\n- WHEN a post is submitted with 4 files attached (above allowed 3), THE system SHALL reject, list files by name exceeding policy, and permit user to adjust selection before retrying action.\n\n### Example: Guest Attempts to Vote on Post\n- WHEN a guest or unauthenticated user tries to upvote or downvote content, THE system SHALL prompt registration/login, preserving intended action (vote will be applied if/when authentication completes).\n\n### Example: Concurrent Edit Attempt\n- WHEN two members submit edits to the same post concurrently, THE system SHALL apply last-write-wins logic, record both edit histories, notify both editors of overwrite/collision, and flag for moderator review if disputed.\n\n### Example: Moderator Removes Content after Edit Window\n- WHEN a member attempts to delete own comment after edit/delete window passes, THE system SHALL block with a timed-out message and suggest moderator escalation; WHEN moderator acts for a business rule violation, THE system SHALL log action with context and retain for 60 days post-event.\n\n### Example: Repeated Bad Report Filing\n- WHEN a member files six unsupported (rejected) abuse reports in seven days, THE system SHALL suspend reporting privileges for that user for 48 hours and notify both user and moderators of action, including right to appeal.\n\n### Example: Escalated User Ban Due to Multiple Incidents\n- WHEN a user accumulates five or more valid abuse reports or three moderator interventions in 30 days, THE system SHALL auto-flag for admin review, restrict posting, and notify the user of impending action and appeal process.\n\n### Example: Data Retention Hold for Legal Investigation\n- WHEN law enforcement, judicial authority, or company counsel requests retention of deleted materials, THE system SHALL exclude affected data from scheduled purge, document the legal hold request, and maintain records securely until official release.\n\n### Example: Attachment Deletion with Post Purge\n- WHEN a post is permanently purged after 60 days, THE system SHALL ensure all associated file attachments are also deleted irreversibly, and log the action in purge report.\n\n---\n\nAll requirements are actionable, measurable, and role-based, using EARS format per section wherever applicable.

Introduction\npolEcoBoard relies on various external services to deliver a secure, compliant, and scalable discussion experience. External integrations—covering authentication, analytics, anti-spam, notification, and consent management—must be designed with clear business rules and workflows. This specification details the necessary business logic, user journeys, error handling, and integration boundaries for all required third-party services, ensuring actionable requirements for backend implementation while avoiding technical or API-specific content. All requirements are given in EARS format or equivalently precise business language for direct execution by the backend team.\n\n## 2. Third-party Service Requirements\n\n### 2.1 Authentication and Identity Providers\n- WHEN a user selects a third-party authentication option (e.g., Google, Facebook, Apple ID), THE system SHALL initiate the provider-specific flow and, upon receiving successful verification, SHALL create or update the user's polEcoBoard profile—storing verified email, display name, and consented metadata.\n- IF a user denies authentication consent or closes the third-party login, THEN THE system SHALL return the user to the login/signup page and present a business error: \"Authentication was canceled by the user. No account changes were made.\"\n- WHERE third-party authentication data delivers an already verified email, THE system SHALL accept the verified status for email and forgo additional email verification steps.\n- IF provider does not confirm verified email, THEN THE system SHALL require independent email verification following primary polEcoBoard workflows.\n- WHERE third-party authentication conflicts with existing accounts (e.g., duplicate emails), THE system SHALL allow account linking or error the operation with a specific message: \"An account with this email already exists. Please link or choose a different provider.\"\n- THE system SHALL support sign-in and sign-up via standard, SSO, and federated identity providers according to user opt-in preferences.\n\n### 2.2 Analytics and Insights Services\n- WHEN users interact with the platform (view, post, comment, vote, report, login, session), THE system SHALL generate an anonymized, non-personal analytics event for each action and transmit it to the analytics provider(s).\n- WHERE users opt out of analytics collection, THE system SHALL not transmit analytics for those sessions or actions, regardless of role.\n- WHEN a guest user interacts, THE system SHALL report only non-identifying session metrics (browser, device, location to region/country-level, no cookies or tracking without explicit consent).\n- THE system SHALL only transmit analytics events containing: action type, user role (non-PII), timestamp, session context, and anonymized identifiers consistent with privacy regulations.\n- WHEN a user requests analytics erasure under privacy law, THE system SHALL signal to analytics providers to remove or anonymize records within the mandated business period.\n\n### 2.3 Anti-spam, Abuse Prevention, and Moderation Tools\n- WHEN a user submits content (post, comment), THE system SHALL transmit the relevant text, user role, content metadata (category, submission rate, language, IP region), to one or more anti-spam verification providers before making the content visible.\n- IF anti-spam provider returns a high-probability or confirmed violation, THEN THE system SHALL prevent content publication and display a business message such as: \"Your submission was flagged by automated review and was not published. You may appeal this decision.\"\n- THE system SHALL provide users with an appeal workflow for false positive anti-spam returns: WHEN a member requests an appeal, THE system SHALL flag submission for manual moderator review and notify the user of the appeal status.\n- WHERE the anti-spam provider is unavailable or slow beyond 5 seconds, THE system SHALL queue submissions for re-validation, inform the user: \"We are experiencing review delays. Your content will be published after successful review.\"\n- WHEN system degradation occurs, THE system SHALL store pending submissions securely until recovery and provide status updates via notification.\n- Moderators and admins SHALL have an audit trail of all anti-spam actions for review and dispute, accessible via the moderation dashboard.\n\n### 2.4 Notification and Messaging Services\n- WHEN a trigger event (reply, mention, moderation action, account update, system notice, report status) occurs, THE system SHALL assemble a notification event containing relevant business metadata (user, role, channel, timestamp, urgency).\n- THE system SHALL route notification to the user's preferred channel (email, push, in-app, or SMS) based on their configured preferences and opt-in status.\n- WHERE delivery of a notification fails (provider/network outage detected by callback or error), THE system SHALL queue the notification for up to 24 hours with retry policies set in business rules. AFTER three consecutive failures, THE system SHALL generate an in-system alert and provide error context in the user's notification history.\n- WHERE users choose to opt out of specific notification channels, THE system SHALL respect their preferences and route only to allowed channels.\n- WHEN required by law, THE system SHALL default critical notifications (e.g., account compromise, policy update) to at least one channel still enabled, and inform the user of mandatory contact policies.\n\n### 2.5 Consent, Privacy, and Data Residency\n- WHEN any integration action requires sharing PII or non-anonymized data with an external provider, THE system SHALL seek explicit, revocable user consent and record consent status for audit.\n- IF a user revokes consent for any integration (analytics, identity, notification), THEN THE system SHALL halt all data transmission to the relevant provider and confirm the change via the user's allowed notification channel within 24 hours.\n- WHERE data residency rules restrict cross-border processing, THE system SHALL use a regionally-appropriate provider, or present explicit legal language informing the user, and require updated consent before transmitting data out-of-region.\n- WHEN privacy rule changes (e.g., new GDPR or equivalent update) affect integration, THE system SHALL suspend outbound integrations for affected users until updated consent is received.\n- Administrative and moderator access to provider integration logs SHALL be limited to business-justified, role-controlled dashboards, with audit trails of who accessed what integration and when.\n\n## 3. Conceptual Data Flow\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph \"User Interaction\"\n        A[\"User Registration/Login\"]\n        B[\"User Post Submission\"]\n        C[\"User Comment/Vote/Report\"]\n        D[\"User Receives Notification\"]\n    end\n    subgraph \"Core System Logic\"\n        E[\"Account Management\"]\n        F[\"Content Validation\"]\n        G[\"Analytics Event Queue\"]\n        H[\"Notification Dispatch\"]\n    end\n    subgraph \"External Integrations\"\n        I[\"Third-party Authentication\"]\n        J[\"Anti-spam Service\"]\n        K[\"Analytics Platform\"]\n        L[\"Notification Provider\"]\n    end\n    A --> E\n    E -->|\"Third-party login\"| I\n    B --> F\n    F --> J\n    C --> G\n    G --> K\n    B --> G\n    F --> H\n    H --> L\n    L --> D\n```\n\n### 3.1 Data Flow Scenarios by User Role\n- WHEN a guest browses public content, THE system SHALL not trigger authentication or privileged data integrations. Analytics events (view, browse) SHALL be anonymized.\n- WHEN a member logs in via SSO, THE system SHALL initiate the provider handshake and update internal sessions only after email verification/consent steps are confirmed.\n- WHEN a moderator/admin takes moderation action, THE system SHALL log event to analytics (with non-PII fields), trigger notification for relevant users, and, where workflow requires, interact with anti-spam provider (escalation flag).\n\n### 3.2 Error and Privacy Flows\n- IF any integration fails (e.g., analytics, notification, anti-spam) due to third-party issues, THE system SHALL provide immediate business explanation to the user, queue or re-attempt data exchange per the business policy, and retain full audit log of each event, result, and retry/failure resolution.\n- WHEN a user exercises privacy rights (delete account, erase analytics record, revoke notification consent), THE system SHALL coordinate a full stop/erasure across all active integrations and confirm completion for audit/compliance.\n\n## 4. Interaction Points with Third-party Services\n\n### 4.1 Authentication Integration\n- WHEN initiating third-party login, THE system SHALL validate provider is enabled and recognized for current locale/user region, and, if blocked or unsupported, inform the user: \"This provider is not supported for your region.\"\n- Admins SHALL be able to configure (enable/disable) third-party providers per business, legal, and operational needs. WHEN a provider is disabled, THE system SHALL present clear explanation on login screens.\n\n### 4.2 Analytics Integration\n- WHEN tracked actions are performed, THE system SHALL submit analytics events in batches where possible to reduce API overhead, except where real-time reporting is required by business rules (e.g., incident/event, moderator action).\n- Members, moderators, and admins SHALL have configurable analytics opt-in/out (where privacy policy allows). Guests SHALL always operate under default anonymized analytics.\n\n### 4.3 Anti-Spam Integration\n- WHEN content is flagged as 'potential abuse' by internal rule or user report, THE system SHALL re-send to external anti-spam provider with additional business context for escalation and investigation.\n- WHEN third-party review is completed, THE system SHALL update content status (approved, held, rejected), notify moderators and affected users, and require manual review for ambiguous or unresolved scores.\n- Moderators SHALL receive special notification for content quarantined by integration, with workflow to release, escalate, or permanently remove.\n\n### 4.4 Notification Service Integration\n- WHEN a business event matches user notification rules, THE system SHALL compose and dispatch notification respecting all user, role, and region-specific settings—audit logging event content, delivery attempts, and user-level feedback (open/read/delete).\n- IF repeated notification failures indicate persistent provider outage, THE system SHALL alert admins and allow switching to backup notification providers per business continuity plan.\n\n### 4.5 Consent, Privacy, and Compliance Integration\n- WHEN user privacy/consent status changes, THE system SHALL retrieve, store, and update provider-side preferences in real time, logging audit results for compliance.\n- IF compliance conflict exists (e.g., data residency region mismatch), THEN THE system SHALL restrict all outbound traffic for the affected user until legal standing is resolved.\n\n## 5. Business Logic for Integrations\n\n### 5.1 Role-Based Integration Access\n- WHERE user role implies restricted integration use (e.g., only moderators/admins may use audit/analytics dashboards, anti-spam override/retry tools, or advanced notification settings), THE system SHALL block unauthorized attempts and present a business explanation in the interface.\n- All privileged actions via integrations SHALL be logged with user, timestamp, operation, and outcome for compliance.\n\n### 5.2 Opt-in/Opt-out and Consent Handling\n- WHEN presenting integration options (analytics, SSO, notifications), THE system SHALL default all non-essential integrations to explicit opt-in, with granular per-user and per-integration settings retained in the account profile.\n- WHEN user status changes (revocation, opt-out, account closure), THE system SHALL update all provider-side status, remove PII, and present audit summary to the user within 24 hours.\n\n### 5.3 Error Handling and Fallbacks\n- IF an external integration (identity, analytics, anti-spam, notification) fails, THEN THE system SHALL log the incident, inform users of delay/impact, and, where function is business-critical, fall back to a manual or backup flow (e.g., manual moderation, in-app alert, batch re-send) until normal integration resumes.\n- IF multiple integrations simultaneously fail (major provider incident), THEN THE system SHALL enter a \"degraded mode,\" limiting new postings and account actions, communicating restrictions via alert banners and status notifications to all users, and ensuring incident status is visible to moderation and admin teams throughout.\n\n### 5.4 Compliance and Region Constraints\n- WHERE residency or compliance law restricts integration, THE system SHALL ensure only compliant providers are used, and shall record user consent and jurisdiction for every transmitted event. WHEN a change occurs, THE system SHALL trigger review by compliance administrators and require re-confirmed consent before re-enabling integrations for those users/accounts.\n\n### 5.5 Scalability, Continuity, and Business Monitoring\n- WHEN integration throughput approaches business or provider limits (API rate limits, quota ceilings), THE system SHALL monitor usage, implement per-provider business-logic backoff and notification, and inform impacted users and admins of degraded features in business language (e.g., delayed updates, retry windows).\n- THE system SHALL support provider switching for critical functions (e.g., backup analytics, alternate notification provider) and require all integrations have business continuity plans executable by admins without technical intervention.\n- All integration logs, consent modifications, opt-in/out events, and error/failure incidents SHALL be available to admins via audit dashboards for review and reporting as part of business compliance measures.\n\n## 6. Reference to Related Documents\nFor detail on user permissions and authentication, see the [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./03-user-roles-auth.md). Business logic for participation, moderation, and user workflows is specified in the [Functional Requirements Document](./05-functional-requirements.md) and [Business Rules and Validation](./08-business-rules.md). Service mission, business value, and compliance metrics appear in the [Service Overview and Business Model](./01-service-overview.md). Operational monitoring and analytics are covered in the [Operations and Reporting Specification](./10-operations-reporting.md).\n\n## 7. Success Criteria and Constraints\n- THE system SHALL provide comprehensive opt-in/out, audit, and notification flows for every integration and user role.\n- All integrations SHALL operate within documented consent, privacy, business, and compliance boundaries at all times.\n- THE system SHALL ensure at least one backup provider or manual fallback for every critical integration. No single provider SHALL constitute a single point of failure for a core system function.\n- Role-based permissions, region, and consent status SHALL be enforced at integration boundary with real-time auditability (logs, dashboards) for moderators and admins.\n- Integration failures SHALL never result in silent data loss or privilege escalation—instead, all flow interruptions SHALL be communicated instantly in actionable business terms to users and staff.\n- Where legislative or compliance requirements change, THE system SHALL pause affected integrations and require explicit new consent from users to resume affected flows.\n- All integration business requirements, error flows, role restrictions, and compliance scenarios described herein are enforceable measures for backend implementation.\n\n## 8. Expanded Glossary\n- **Integration**: Business-governed transfer or sharing of data with external service providers (not technical contacts/APIs).\n- **Consent**: Active, revocable agreement by the user to share specific data for specific integrations, with record-traceable audit.\n- **Third-party Provider**: Any approved external service trusted by polEcoBoard for non-core functions (auth, analytics, notifications, anti-spam, compliance).\n- **Business Boundary**: The logical perimeter at which polEcoBoard delegates process or decision to an external party, triggering business process completion or waiting for response.\n- **Degraded Mode**: Temporary statewide restriction of features pending restoration of essential external integrations; communicated in business language platform-wide.\n- **Audit Trail**: Immutable business record of integration actions, consent changes, error incidents, and privileged access for compliance review.\n- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Any data that can identify a user directly or indirectly—treated with explicit consent and residency compliance.\n- **Manual Fallback**: Human (moderator/admin) process used to maintain business process continuity when automation or integration is impaired.\n- **Role-based Access**: Principle limiting integration use to users with permission (e.g., only admins can review logs, only moderators can override anti-spam decisions, etc.).\n- **Provider Switching**: Business process to change between approved providers in case of outage, regional restriction, or compliance need.\n- **Region and Residency**: Data locality jurisdiction governing what providers and flows are permissible; requires per-event compliance and auditability.\n\n---\n\nAll requirements, scenarios, and flows specified are business-facing only.

System Operation and Monitoring\n\n### 1.1 Service Health and Uptime Monitoring\n- THE system SHALL provide real-time health indicators covering API responsiveness, database connectivity, major background services, and external third-party integrations.\n- WHEN any monitored subsystem (API, DB, service, integration) becomes unresponsive for more than 30 seconds, THE system SHALL trigger a service alert visible to admins.\n- WHEN system-wide error rates exceed 1% within a rolling 5-minute window, THE system SHALL log this as an operational event and notify admins immediately.\n- THE system SHALL support summary dashboards aggregating service uptime, latency, error frequencies, content publishing rates, and login activity.\n- WHERE system monitoring is degraded or data sources are missing, THE system SHALL mark the impacted metrics as unavailable and raise an admin-only warning event.\n\n### 1.2 Operational Dashboards\n- THE system SHALL allow admins to view dashboards summarizing current and historical stats for user sign-ups, posts, comments, votes, abuse reports, suspensions/bans, and system errors.\n- THE system SHALL allow moderators access to dashboards specific to their moderation areas (e.g., content queue length, flagged posts, review status).\n- WHERE a member accesses operational dashboards, THE system SHALL restrict access to only their own contribution summaries and exclude system-wide metrics.\n- THE system SHALL automatically refresh dashboard data at intervals no longer than 60 seconds.\n\n### 1.3 Alerting and Proactive Notification\n- WHEN system performance degrades (e.g., 95th percentile response time exceeds 2 seconds or job queues exceed thresholds), THE system SHALL generate operational alerts for admins.\n- WHEN the number of unresolved abuse reports exceeds the configured threshold, THE system SHALL alert moderators responsible for that content category.\n- WHEN a scheduled maintenance window is upcoming (within 24 hours), THE system SHALL notify all moderators and admins with the expected downtime, scope, and recovery plan.\n\n### 1.4 Data Retention and Compliance Operations\n- THE system SHALL allow admins to configure data retention periods for business audit data, error logs, abuse reports, and user activity based on policy and compliance requirements.\n- WHEN retention limits are reached, THE system SHALL perform automated purging consistent with policy and audit requirements, with full event records prior to erasure.\n- IF retention policies are changed, THEN THE system SHALL log and report such changes to admins for review.\n\n\n## 2. Business Event Processing (Moderation, Reports, User Actions)\n\n### 2.1 Event Tracking and Auditing\n- THE system SHALL record detailed audit trails for all moderator and admin actions, including content deletion/restoration, user suspensions, policy changes, and configuration updates.\n- WHEN a moderator or admin changes any policy or configuration, THE system SHALL require an action description and reason for the audit log.\n- WHEN a user (member, guest) is subjected to a moderation action (warning, suspension, ban, content edit/deletion), THE system SHALL record the event, responsible staff, and user notification status.\n\n### 2.2 Notification and Escalation Flows\n- WHEN content is reported by users, THE system SHALL queue it for moderator review, recording timestamps for report, assignment, review, and resolution.\n- IF reported content is not reviewed within the business-defined SLA (e.g., 24 hours), THEN THE system SHALL escalate the event to admins with priority notification.\n- WHEN moderators close abuse reports, THE system SHALL notify the reporting member of the decision with a status code (accepted, rejected, action taken, no action).\n\n### 2.3 Event-Based Automation\n- WHEN content thresholds are reached (e.g., post receives >N reports or downvotes in M minutes), THE system SHALL temporarily hide the content pending moderator review, notify all affected parties, and log the action.\n- WHEN a user’s privileges are automatically restricted due to behavioral triggers (e.g., repeated abuse, excessive spam, failed login attempts), THE system SHALL notify the user, responsible moderator, and log the reason and evidence.\n- WHERE admins designate an event as sensitive (e.g., election interference, major legal risk), THE system SHALL enable enhanced tracking, limiting event data access strictly to moderators and admins assigned to that review.\n\n### 2.4 Example: Moderation Lifecycle (Mermaid)\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph \"Business Event Processing\"\n        A[\"Content Reported by Member\"] --> B[\"Event Queued for Moderator Review\"]\n        B --> C{\"Is SLA Breached?\"}\n        C -->|\"No\"| D[\"Moderator Reviews Report\"]\n        D --> E{\"Action Needed?\"}\n        E -->|\"Yes\"| F[\"Content Modified/Removed\"]\n        E -->|\"No\"| G[\"No Action Taken\"]\n        F --> H[\"Reporter Notified - Action Taken\"]\n        G --> I[\"Reporter Notified - No Action\"]\n        C -->|\"Yes\"| J[\"Escalated to Admin\"]\n    end\n```\n\n\n## 3. Administrative Analytics and Reporting Needs\n\n### 3.1 Core Business Metrics\n- THE system SHALL support reports and data exports for admins covering:\n    - User growth and activity trends (DAU, WAU, MAU)\n    - Content creation rates, engagement volumes\n    - Moderation workload (reviewed/closed reports per period, time-to-resolution, decision types)\n    - Abuse report response rates, outcomes, and escalation frequency\n    - User retention, suspensions, bans, and appeals statistics\n    - Popular discussion topics, trending tags, and top contributors\n    - Audit log summaries by staff and event type\n    - Data subject access requests and deletion requests (compliance)\n- WHERE moderators access analytics, THE system SHALL filter results to only their assigned categories/content areas.\n- WHERE members access analytics, THE system SHALL restrict visibility to their own activity (contributions, reports, bans/suspensions received).\n\n### 3.2 Custom and Scheduled Reports\n- THE system SHALL allow admins (and authorized moderators) to configure scheduled recurring reports (daily/weekly/monthly) for key operational and business metrics, delivered via secure notification.\n- WHEN ad-hoc reporting is requested, THE system SHALL provide selectable criteria for content type, user cohort, time range, and moderation event types.\n- WHEN a report is generated, THE system SHALL log the report request, creator, and delivery status for auditability.\n- WHERE regulatory or compliance reports are required (e.g., data export of banned users), THE system SHALL provide compliant data exports and audit their issuance.\n\n### 3.3 Notification and Data Access Permissions\n- THE system SHALL enforce strict role-based access for all analytics—billing/usage, moderation, user growth, and compliance—with visibility set by the permission matrix (see [User Roles and Authentication Business Requirement Document](./03-user-roles-auth.md)).\n- WHERE an analytics/reporting function is attempted by an unauthorized role, THE system SHALL deny access and record the attempt.\n\n\n## 4. Incident and Change Management\n\n### 4.1 Service Incident Tracking\n- THE system SHALL record all significant service disruptions including downtime, major errors, failed integrations, or degraded performance as separate incident events.\n- WHEN an incident reaches business-defined thresholds (e.g., >5 mins outage, critical error), THE system SHALL initiate a formal incident record with timestamps, nature of disruption, responsible staff, communication sequence, and resolution details.\n- THE system SHALL provide admins with a timeline view of incident occurrence, investigation, mitigation, and recovery.\n- WHEN an incident is resolved, THE system SHALL require a resolution summary and optionally attach follow-up tasks or business process reviews.\n\n### 4.2 Audit Trails for Change Management\n- WHEN any business policy, role permission, configuration, or notification template is changed, THE system SHALL log the before/after state, user, timestamp, and reason for change.\n- THE system SHALL allow admins to search and filter all change records by time, actor, and area of impact.\n- WHERE any unauthorized attempt to change protected settings is made, THE system SHALL block the attempt, notify admins, and log the event for escalation.\n\n### 4.3 Example: Incident Management Flow (Mermaid)\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph \"Incident Lifecycle\"\n        A[\"Service Incident Detected\"] --> B[\"Incident Record Created\"]\n        B --> C[\"Staff Assignment and Acknowledgement\"]\n        C --> D[\"Investigation Ongoing\"]\n        D --> E{\"Mitigated?\"}\n        E -->|\"Yes\"| F[\"Normal Operations Restored\"]\n        E -->|\"No\"| G[\"Escalate to Admin/External Support\"]\n        F --> H[\"Resolution Summary Logged\"]\n        G --> H\n    end\n```\n\n\n## 5. Role-Based Permission Matrix for Operations/Reporting\n\n| Action/Feature                                               | Guest | Member | Moderator | Admin |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|:-----:|:------:|:---------:|:-----:|\n| View operational dashboards (overall/system-wide)            |  ❌   |   ❌   |   ❌      |  ✅  |\n| View own activity dashboard                                  |  ❌   |   ✅   |   ✅      |  ✅  |\n| View moderation queue / category dashboards                  |  ❌   |   ❌   |   ✅      |  ✅  |\n| Access error/service health monitoring                       |  ❌   |   ❌   |   ❌      |  ✅  |\n| Audit logs (actions, policy/config changes)                  |  ❌   |   ❌   |   ✅      |  ✅  |\n| Business analytics (overall)                                 |  ❌   |   ❌   |   ❌      |  ✅  |\n| Analytics (category-specific)                                |  ❌   |   ❌   |   ✅      |  ✅  |\n| Analytics (own contributions)                                |  ❌   |   ✅   |   ✅      |  ✅  |\n| Receive system incident/maintenance alerts                   |  ❌   |   ❌   |   ✅      |  ✅  |\n| Change management / config updates                           |  ❌   |   ❌   |   ❌      |  ✅  |\n| Request/receive scheduled/adhoc reports                      |  ❌   |   ❌   |   ✅      |  ✅  |\n| Export compliance/legal data (users, abuse, audit, etc.)     |  ❌   |   ❌   |   ❌      |  ✅  |\n\n\n## 6. Error and Exception Handling for Operation Events\n- IF any reporting, audit, or analytics function fails due to data retrieval errors, access denial, or policy mismatch, THEN THE system SHALL notify the user with a specific error code and log the incident for review.\n- IF a scheduled or generated report cannot be delivered to the intended recipient, THEN THE system SHALL provide delivery status with guidance on re-issue or escalation.\n- IF retention or compliance policy conflicts are detected during a purge, THEN THE system SHALL halt the operation, notify admins, and require business input/info before proceeding.\n- WHEN operational alerts are triggered but no designated staff acknowledges within SLA, THE system SHALL escalate and record the event.\n\n\n## 7. Performance and Responsiveness\n- WHEN operational dashboards or reports are accessed by authorized users, THE system SHALL load data and visualizations within 3 seconds under normal operating loads.\n- WHEN event or incident data is recorded, THE system SHALL ensure the audit or incident entry is available for review within 5 seconds of event completion.\n\n\n## 8.
