The overarching vision is to empower citizens, experts, and policymakers to engage constructively, fostering informed debate and responsible participation in democracy. \n\n**Mission:**\n- Provide a trusted digital environment that raises the standard of public discourse on political and economic issues.\n- Enable inclusive participation through easy registration, clear role-based privileges, and intuitive workflows for users of all backgrounds.\n- Promote freedom of expression while enforcing respectful behavior and factual dialogue, guided by transparent moderation.\n- Supply actionable insights to stakeholders via a reliable, well-governed, and continually improving community platform.\n\n# Target Audience and Market Opportunity\n\n## Target Audience\n- Civically engaged citizens and newcomers interested in learning or participating in debates.\n- Students, academics, and professionals advancing research and policy analysis.\n- Journalists, advocacy groups, policy advisors seeking direct access to authentic public sentiment.\n- Moderators and administrators dedicated to governance and safeguarding debate standards.\n\n## Market Opportunity\n- Increased skepticism toward mainstream social platforms due to misinformation, polarization, and lack of accountability presents an opportunity for a rigorously moderated and policy-aligned alternative.\n- Escalating importance of civic literacy and evidence-based analysis in policymaking generates demand for a community with high-quality contributions, real-time moderation, and organizational partnerships.\n- Gaps in global/regional platforms that combine robust governance, nuanced discussion, user accountability, and direct channels for expert/organization participation.\n\n# Problem Statement\n\nThe current digital landscape is marked by diminishing trust, poor moderation, and manipulation of information.\n- Traditional forums lack robust mechanisms for ensuring sustained quality, fairness, and safety in debate.\n- Widespread issues include harassment, echo chambers, low signal-to-noise ratio, and unreliable content validation.\n- Difficulty exists for newcomers and experts alike to locate credible, well-governed discussion spaces focused on actionable political and economic topics.\n\n# Core Value Proposition\n\npoliticalEconomicBoard addresses these problems by integrating differentiated user roles, advanced moderation, and transparent governance.\n- WHEN a guest enters the platform, THE system SHALL allow access to public content and browsing only, maintaining full data privacy and ensuring the integrity of open discourse.\n- WHEN a member is registered and authenticated, THE system SHALL permit content contributions (posts, comments), reactions (votes, emojis), and reporting mechanisms, establishing an accountable and credible user base.\n- WHEN a moderator acts, THE system SHALL empower action over content (flag, edit, delete), oversee community standards, and expedite abuse reporting within established guidelines.\n- WHEN an administrator intervenes, THE system SHALL enable full oversight of users, policy, platform integrity, and compliance processes, including audit and escalation paths for complex issues.\n- Robust authentication/authorization structures SHALL prevent coordinated manipulation, spam, and bot activity, protecting the value of community discussions.\n- Distinct content channels, advanced voting, and nuanced reaction tools SHALL enable ranking, organization, and amplification of high-quality contributions.\n- Business and organizational partners are supported by specialized channels, analytic dashboards, and transparent moderation/reporting, allowing two-way engagement with constituents.\n- IF an error or abuse occurs (e.g., harassment, misinformation), THEN THE system SHALL route the incident to appropriate moderation for timely resolution and provide clear reporting and appeals procedures, with all actions fully auditable.\n\n# Business Model\n\n## Why This Service Exists\n- WHEN mainstream platforms are insufficient for high-quality, civil debate on political and economic matters, THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL fulfill the market gap by creating a purpose-built space with enforceable community standards, rigorous moderation, and accessible archiving of valuable discourse.\n\n## Revenue Strategy\n- Freemium model: WHEN a user accesses the platform, THE system SHALL provide core features (browsing, posting, participating in discussions) to all members at no cost, but premium services (advanced reporting, analytics, priority channels, customizable feeds) SHALL be offered via subscription.\n- WHERE organizations or experts seek branded engagement, THE system SHALL offer sponsored channels and partnership packages, enabling monetization via institutional relationships.\n- WHERE targeted advertising is permitted, THE system SHALL restrict it to non-premium tiers and ensure full neutrality and separation between advertising and editorial or policy influence.\n- In the long term, output data and knowledge-based research services (e.g., trend analyses, sentiment reporting) SHALL be available under contract, strictly adhering to privacy/legal frameworks.\n\n## Growth Plan\n- WHEN early user acquisition is targeted, THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL conduct partnerships with educational institutions, research centers, and civic organizations to seed high-value contributors.\n- Organic growth SHALL be incentivized by enabling sharing of public debates, showcasing expert/member recognition, and making member onboarding as frictionless as possible.\n- Expert retention SHALL be promoted via modular profiles, reputation systems, and opportunities to host branded or moderated discussions.\n- Moderator experience and tooling SHALL evolve in parallel with user growth, focusing on scalable review, fair escalation procedures, and training resources.\n\n## Business Operations and Governance\n- THE system SHALL maintain continuous onboarding and compliance education flows for all user roles (members, moderators, administrators).\n- Content organization and navigation SHALL be enabled through category, channel, and tag management under administrator supervision.\n- Platform health SHALL be assessed regularly via feedback, audits, and community surveys, iteratively updating business processes, role requirements, and moderation guidelines as needed.\n- WHEN business risks are detected (manipulation, bot attacks, abusive behavior), THE system SHALL activate mitigation protocols, inform stakeholders, and update operational policies in compliance with all relevant legal/ethical requirements.\n\n# Key Differentiators\n\n- Strict role-based access and permission controls, featuring a clearly defined hierarchy (guest, member, moderator, administrator) and a permission matrix for every action (see [User Roles and Authentication Guide](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md)).\n- Comprehensive moderation: WHEN violations are reported or detected, THE system SHALL empower moderators and administrators to rapidly review, act, and audit outcomes, with appeal and escalation channels for users, supporting procedural fairness.\n- Industry-leading transparency, with permanent audit trails for all content actions and an analytic dashboard for performance monitoring and governance.\n- Granular organization of debates by channel, topic, and tag, enabling precise navigation and search, while supporting content surfacing via member and moderator curation.\n- Integration with external fact-checking/moderation APIs as outlined in [External Integrations Requirements](./08-external-integrations.md) to further enforce quality, objectivity, and compliance.\n- Robust reporting and error recovery workflows, including formal content appeal and dispute procedures, as specified in [Error Handling and Edge Cases](./06-error-handling-and-edge-cases.md).\n- Multi-stakeholder value creation: supporting not only individual users, but also organizations and experts with advanced engagement, reporting, and audience measurement tools.\n- Adherence to leading privacy, accessibility, and non-functional standards (see [Non-Functional Requirements and Compliance](./07-non-functional-requirements.md)).\n\n#

Defines in business terms all processes, workflows, and requirements developers need to build robust, resilient authentication and authorization for the platform.\n\n## User Role Definitions\n\n### Guest\n- Allowed to browse public discussion content only, strictly read-only.\n- Cannot post, comment, vote, react, report, or access any functionality beyond viewing public threads.\n- WHEN a guest attempts to perform any protected action (post, comment, vote, react, report, manage profile, etc.), THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL inform the guest that registration or login is required, specifying next steps for access.\n- IF a guest tries to access a restricted page directly (by URL), THEN THE system SHALL redirect to the login or registration prompt with a descriptive, actionable message.\n\n### Member\n- Registered, verified user with standard participation rights.\n- Can create, edit, and delete their own posts and comments within community guidelines and time limits.\n- Can vote and react (once per item), and report content suspected of violating rules.\n- Cannot modify, edit, or delete any other user’s contributions for any reason.\n- WHEN a member submits posts or comments, THE system SHALL attribute authorship and timestamp the content accurately.\n- WHEN a member edits or deletes personal content, THE system SHALL permit action only within policy limits (e.g., up to 24 hours post-creation; see business rules).\n- WHEN a member reports content, THE system SHALL log details, notify moderators in near real-time, and update the member on resolution status.\n- IF a member attempts unauthorized actions (edit/delete others’ content, access moderation), THEN THE system SHALL deny the attempt and show a clear, contextual denial message.\n- WHEN a member is suspended or restricted, THE system SHALL immediately revoke all permissions and log an audit event.\n\n### Moderator\n- Registered user promoted to enforce platform guidelines; responsible for fair, timely, and unbiased moderation of content and behavior.\n- Can review, edit, or delete any post/comment, access all reports, and temporarily suspend members violating community rules (cannot suspend other moderators or administrators).\n- WHEN a moderator accesses reports, THE system SHALL provide all context, including content, report details, and historical actions.\n- WHEN a moderator edits or deletes another user’s content, THE system SHALL log the action, including reason, timestamp, and affected user notification, and keep an immutable audit trail.\n- WHEN acting on member suspensions, THE system SHALL require the moderator to enter a justification, duration, and notify both the suspended member and administrators.\n- IF a moderator tries to exceed authority (edit admin content, extend suspensions beyond limits), THEN THE system SHALL block the action and alert the administrator.\n- Moderators cannot promote, demote, or alter platform settings.\n\n### Administrator\n- Account with unrestricted platform oversight; may manage all users and settings.\n- May invite, suspend, or promote/demote members and moderators, adjust system settings, access complete logs, and intervene in any compliance or escalation scenario.\n- WHEN an administrator changes user roles, settings, or reviews escalations, THE system SHALL log each action in detail (actor, timestamp, before/after state, justification).\n- WHEN an administrator investigates compliance or audit requests, THE system SHALL grant unlimited, read-only access to all logs and user actions.\n- IF an administrator acts to suspend/restore roles or privileges, THEN THE system SHALL immediately enforce changes, prompt for rationale, and inform affected parties.\n- Administrators have sole ability to override system policy during critical incidents or policy updates, with business-side rationale required for audit.\n\n## Authentication Requirements\n\n- THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL support account registration using verified email address and password as a minimum.\n- WHEN a user registers, THE system SHALL require email verification via unique token or OTP before activating the account for member privileges.\n- WHEN a user logs in, THE system SHALL validate credentials and issue a session within 2 seconds; unsuccessful logins SHALL be rejected with a generic error for security.\n- WHEN a user logs out, THE system SHALL terminate their session and invalidate all associated tokens within 2 seconds.\n- WHEN forgotten password is initiated, THE system SHALL send reset instructions to the registered email immediately, and require completion within 1 hour.\n- WHEN user provides a valid reset link, THE system SHALL allow password update, prompt for re-authentication, and invalidate all prior sessions.\n- WHEN a user attempts protected actions without valid session (via browser or API), THE system SHALL return a permission error and redirect to login, with clear next-step guidance.\n- WHEN a user exceeds 5 consecutive failed login attempts, THE system SHALL lock the account for 15 minutes, notify the user via registered email (if available), and log an audit record.\n- WHEN email verification tokens expire (e.g., after 24 hours), THE system SHALL invalidate the pending registration and offer a resend feature.\n- WHEN an active session expires via timeout (e.g., after 30 minutes inactivity), THE system SHALL require re-authentication and present a session timeout message on next access.\n- WHERE required by policy, THE system SHALL offer multi-factor authentication and prompt users to enroll during registration or account update.\n- WHEN a user requests device/session revocation, THE system SHALL immediately end all active sessions except the current device/token, and notify the user of affected endpoints.\n\n## Role Hierarchy and Permissions\n\n- Guest < Member < Moderator < Administrator; higher roles inherit all lower-level permissions, but business policy restricts moderation and administrator actions to their explicit business scope.\n- WHEN a member is promoted (e.g., to moderator), THE system SHALL require administrator approval, record context/rationale, and update user privileges instantly following approval.\n- WHEN any user’s role or permission set is changed, THE system SHALL ensure that all new sessions and any new tokens immediately reflect the changes; the user SHALL be informed on their next session start.\n- IF an account is suspended or demoted, THEN THE system SHALL immediately revoke associated permissions and terminate active sessions.\n- WHEN a moderator or administrator reverses a suspension/demotion, THE system SHALL restore permissions, inform the affected user, and log the change for audit.\n- WHERE a role change would result in a privilege loss affecting in-progress actions, THE system SHALL block those actions and prompt the user to retry after policy review.\n- IF a role escalation or demotion is contested or is triggered by suspicious behavior, THEN THE system SHALL automatically flag the case for admin review and suspend high-impact permissions until resolved.\n\n## Permission Matrix\n\n| Platform Action                                     | Guest | Member | Moderator | Administrator

administrators.\n- Only administrators may alter roles, change permissions, or access all logs and settings.\n- All role changes and privilege escalations require explicit rationale capture for compliance review.\n\n## Token Management and Security\n\n- THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL issue JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) for all authenticated sessions, containing userId, assigned role, permissions array, and issued/expiry timestamps.\n- Access tokens SHALL be valid for 30 minutes of activity; refresh tokens SHALL allow re-authorization within 14 days of last use.\n- WHEN a user logs out or requests all-device logout, THE system SHALL instantly invalidate all associated tokens.\n- IF a role is changed, account suspended, or restored, THEN THE system SHALL terminate all prior sessions and require fresh authentication with updated privileges.\n- WHEN a token’s signature is invalid (tampering, invalid or revoked key), THE system SHALL reject the token and force re-authentication.\n- Token payloads SHALL NOT include sensitive personal or credential data; only business-necessary information per minimum-privilege principle.\n- THE system SHALL require a secure secret key rotation policy and enable emergency revocation with immediate platform-wide effect.\n- THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL track last-login and token issuance for audit and security monitoring.\n\n## Comprehensive Error Handling\n\n- IF credentials are incorrect, THEN THE system SHALL respond with a generic error (“Invalid email and/or password”) and SHALL NOT reveal which credential failed.\n- WHEN an account is locked due to failed logins, THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL display a clear lockout message with the unlock schedule and instructions for password reset or support contact.\n- WHEN email verification fails due to expiry or token misuse, THE system SHALL prompt to request a new verification email and block access until completed.\n- IF any non-authorized user attempts protected actions, THEN THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL forbid access and display the required role for that action.\n- WHEN a member is suspended or restricted, THE system SHALL display a suspension message with appeal instructions and the suspension reason/duration, and SHALL provide a structured appeal submission flow.\n- WHEN a role change or permission update occurs while a session is active, THE system SHALL interrupt the session at next action and require immediate re-authentication, presenting a message with context.\n- IF any error occurs during registration, authentication, or session management, THEN THE system SHALL log the event for review and SHALL provide guidance to the user for next steps, including retry, account recovery, or support.\n- WHEN a guest or member tries to access an expired/verifiably invalid password reset link, THE system SHALL explain the error and provide the correct pathway to re-initiate the process securely.\n- THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL implement all error responses within 2 seconds under typical load.\n\n## Performance and Usability Requirements\n\n- WHEN performing any authentication, login, logout, registration, or permission verification, THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL respond within 2 seconds in the user interface (excluding bulk data export, audit, or exceptional system events).\n- WHEN authentication or permission error occurs, THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL immediately (within 2 seconds) display a contextual, non-technical error message and offer actionable steps for resolution (e.g., “Resend verification email”, “Reset password”, “Contact support”).\n- THE system SHALL support persistent but secure login (remember-me option), honoring token validity up to refresh token limits while enabling single-action logout from all devices at any time.\n- WHEN users navigate between protected resources while authenticated, THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL transparently manage permissions, only requiring re-authentication on privilege elevation, session expiry, or security event.\n- Usability of recovery and support flows (forgotten password, appeal processes) must be trackable and average user completion time SHALL be under 5 minutes for each flow (business KPI).\n- All error, suspension, and permission messages SHALL be clear, actionable, and non-technical in tone.\n\n##

Specification](./04-business-rules.md).\n- Practical workflow examples and edge-case user stories appear in [User Journey and Exceptional Flow Scenarios](./05-user-journeys.md) and [Error Handling and Edge Case Reference](./06-error-handling-and-edge-cases.md).\n- Broader technical, performance, and compliance topics are specified in the [Non-Functional Requirements and Compliance Document](./07-non-functional-requirements.md).\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL maintain a successful login rate above 98% on a rolling 30-day window.\n- Average forgotten password follow-up instruction delivery and successful reset completion rate SHALL remain above 95% of requests.\n- The platform SHALL achieve zero unauthorized access to member, moderator, or admin

All features, workflows, and logic are captured with explicit detail to ensure backend developers can implement the platform’s business needs with no ambiguity. Technical implementation decisions are left entirely to developers.\n\n## Post Creation and Management\n- THE system SHALL allow members to create new discussion posts within allowed categories and with required metadata (such as title, body, tags).\n- WHEN a member submits a new post, THE system SHALL validate input for minimum/maximum length (title: 10-100 characters, body: 50-10,000 characters), permitted characters, and presence of at least one allowed tag.\n- IF a post contains prohibited content (as defined in business rules), THEN THE system SHALL block submission and return a specific error message.\n- WHEN submissions are accepted, THE system SHALL timestamp posts, associate them with the author’s profile, set initial visibility to public (unless flagged for moderation), and make the post immediately accessible to all users.\n- THE system SHALL allow members to edit or delete their own posts at any time within 24 hours of posting; AFTER this window, posts may only be edited or deleted by moderators or administrators.\n- WHEN a moderator edits or deletes a post, THE system SHALL log the action with justification for audit purposes and notify the author.\n\n## Comment System\n- THE system SHALL allow members to add comments on any public post.\n- WHEN a member adds a comment, THE system SHALL validate content (length: 5-1,000 characters, permitted characters, absence of prohibited content).\n- THE system SHALL allow members to edit or delete their own comments at any time within 12 hours of posting.\n- WHEN a moderator edits or deletes a comment, THE system SHALL record the action with rationale and notify the comment’s author.\n- THE system SHALL nest comments up to 3 levels deep to support discussions.\n\n## Voting and Reactions\n- THE system SHALL permit members to upvote/downvote posts and comments, each user only once per item.\n- WHEN a member votes, THE system SHALL immediately update the item’s score and reflect changes in real-time statistics.\n- IF a member attempts to vote more than once on the same post/comment, THEN THE system SHALL return an error and prevent duplicate actions.\n- THE system SHALL record all voting actions for auditability.\n- THE system SHALL allow members to react with predefined emojis (e.g., like, insight, question) to posts/comments, with each member only one reaction per item.\n\n## Reporting and Moderation\n- THE system SHALL enable all members to report any post or comment for policy violations, specifying the violation type and optional description.\n- WHEN a report is submitted, THE system SHALL log the report, notify moderators, and restrict content visibility if the report meets defined severity thresholds.\n- THE system SHALL provide moderators with a dashboard listing all open reports, with tools to review evidence, rule on validity, take moderation actions (delete, edit, restrict), and record outcomes.\n- THE system SHALL notify reporting users and affected content authors of moderation decisions.\n- IF a moderator acts outside defined guidelines (e.g., deleting without justification), THEN THE system SHALL alert administrators for review.\n\n## Search and Discovery\n- THE system SHALL allow all users (including guests) to search posts and comments using keywords, tags, categories, and author names.\n- WHEN a search is performed, THE system SHALL return results ordered by relevance and recency, highlighting matches.\n- Search responses SHALL be delivered within 2 seconds for typical queries (under 10,000 posts).\n- THE system SHALL allow search filtering by time range, category, or status (open/closed, moderated).\n- IF no results are found, THEN THE system SHALL offer suggestions or category browsing as alternatives.\n\n## Notification System\n- THE system SHALL send notifications to members for key events: replies to their posts/comments, votes received, reports against their content, changes in moderation status, and system announcements.\n- Notifications SHALL be available in two forms: (A) in-app notification list within the user profile, and (B) email notification (user opt-in required).\n- WHEN a notification is triggered, THE system SHALL deliver it within 10 seconds of the triggering event.\n- THE system SHALL allow users to mark notifications as read, delete them, and set preferences for email notifications by category.\n\n## Content Organization and Tagging\n- THE system SHALL require each post to belong to one primary category (e.g., politics, economics, current events) and allow at least one and up to five tags (from a curated list).\n- THE system SHALL maintain a master list of categories and approved tags.\n- THE system SHALL allow administrators to add, edit, disable, or delete categories and tags.\n- THE system SHALL provide filtering and browsing by category and tag on the main board.\n\n## User Profile Management\n- THE system SHALL provide every member with a personal profile page, editable by the member.\n- THE profile SHALL include: display name, bio, profile photo (optional), join date, post/comment statistics, and visible badges/achievements.\n- THE system SHALL allow members to change display name (up to once per month), update bio, and upload or remove a profile image (JPG/PNG, max 2MB).\n- THE system SHALL ensure only the profile owner and administrators can edit profile information.\n- THE system SHALL display aggregate user activity (posts, comments, votes) and a summary of recent activity publically, respecting user privacy settings.\n\n## Performance Requirements\n- WHEN loading posts, THE system SHALL display the first page of the latest 20 posts within 1 second under normal server load.\n- WHEN submitting a post/comment/vote, THE system SHALL update all relevant counters and statistics instantly (<1 second perceived latency).\n- THE system SHALL maintain at least 99.5% uptime (monthly basis).\n\n## Comprehensive Error Handling\n- IF a user action fails due to input validation, THEN THE system SHALL present a specific error message indicating what was wrong (e.g., “Comment too short – minimum 5 characters required”).\n- IF a reported content is subjected to moderation, THEN THE system SHALL inform the author of the outcome with actionable guidance.\n- IF a system error or downtime occurs, THEN THE system SHALL serve an informative error page with recovery guidance (retry, contact support, etc.).\n\n## Business Rules & Validation\n- Posts and comments must not contain prohibited content (hate speech, personal attacks, explicit material, misinformation).\n- Members may not post more than 10 new posts or 50 comments per 24-hour period.\n- Duplicate content, spam, and automated submissions are not allowed; IF detected, THEN THE system SHALL block the submission and notify the member.\n- Tag and category selection is mandatory on post creation.\n- Voting is limited to one upvote and one downvote per post/comment per member.\n\n## Diagrams (Mermaid)\n\n### Example: Post Creation & Moderation Flow\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Member Submits Post\"] --> B{\"Valid

this document, written in natural language using EARS format where applicable, must be fully implemented.\n- Error handling and validation are integral to every workflow.\n- Business rules must be strictly enforced across all features.\n- All timing, restriction, and validation requirements must be testable from a backend perspective.\n\nThis document provides business requirements only. All technical implementation decisions belong to the developer team. The document describes WHAT the system should do, not HOW to build it."},{"reason":"To describe the business rules, validation logic, and operational policies governing key actions and decision points within the platform.","filename":"04-business-rules.md","documentType":"requirement","outline":["Post and Comment Validations","Moderation Criteria and Limits","Voting and Reputation Rules","Prohibited Content Definition","Content Removal and Appeal Process"],"audience":"backend developers and moderators","detailLevel":"detailed specification","content":"# Business Rules and Validation Logic for politicalEconomicBoard\n\n## Introduction\n\nAll platform business rules, validation logic, and operational policies for politicalEconomicBoard are fully defined for backend developers and moderators. The goal is to ensure system behavior is unambiguous at all decision points: post/comment creation, moderation, voting, removal, reputation, and appeals. Requirements employ EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) for clarity and implementation-readiness.\n\n## Post and Comment Validations\n\n### Creation and Editing\n- THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL require each post to have a title of 10-100 characters (no empty, overly short, or excessively long titles permitted) and a body between 50-10,000 characters.\n- THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL require every comment to have a body of 5-1,000 characters—submissions outside this range SHALL be rejected with a clear error message.\n- WHEN a member submits a post or comment, THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL validate that content does not contain prohibited patterns including, but not limited to, excessive profanity, dangerous or blacklisted links, and injection attempts.\n- WHEN a post or comment contains a URL, THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL validate that all links are well-formed and not on a current blocklist of spam or malicious domains.\n- WHEN editing content, THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL allow changes by the original author only and only within 24 hours of original submission; after this period, edits are restricted to moderators and administrators.\n\n### Deletion\n- WHEN a member requests deletion of their post or comment, THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL remove the content from public view, but retain a copy for audit/moderation for a minimum of 180 days.\n- WHEN a moderator deletes content for a business rule violation, THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL log the action, capturing moderator identity, user, reason, timestamp, and content summary.\n\n### Limits and Quotas\n- THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL limit members to no more than 10 new posts and 50 comments per 24-hour rolling window. Attempts to exceed quotas SHALL be rejected instantly, citing remaining quota.\n- IF a user attempts content creation while suspended or restricted, THEN THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL reject the action with a detailed explanation.\n\n### Input Validation Error Handling\n- IF required fields are missing or malformed, THEN THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL return an actionable error in under 2 seconds detailing the exact problem (e.g., “Body must contain at least 50 characters.”).\n- WHEN content matching known spam or dangerous content patterns is submitted, THE system SHALL refuse submission, record the attempt, and notify moderators if repeat occurrences are detected from the same account.\n\n## Moderation Criteria and Limits\n\n### Triggers for Moderation\n- WHEN a post or comment is reported by a member, flagged by an automated detection system, or directly reviewed by a moderator, THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL mark it for moderation review and log the report including reporter, timestamp, and reported violation type.\n\n### Moderation Powers and Workflows\n- Moderators are empowered to edit or remove posts/comments that are flagged or are clear violations of business rules. All moderator actions SHALL be fully audited with before/after content snapshots, reasons, and notifications to affected users.\n- Moderators MAY NOT modify content already adjudicated by a peer moderator unless an escalation event (e.g., formal appeal or admin override) is triggered.\n- WHEN a moderator takes action, THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL record the event, standardize the reason from a fixed list (e.g., hate speech, misinformation, spam, harassment, off-topic), increment the action tally for performance monitoring, and message both the affected user and moderation team in under 10 seconds.\n\n### Flagging & Auto-Hide\n- WHEN a post or comment receives five unique member reports within 24 hours, THE system SHALL mask the content from regular users (auto-hide) pending review, but keep it visible to moderators and the author.\n- IF 20 or more unique members report a post/comment within any 24-hour period, THEN THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL escalate priority, hide content system-wide, and alert all moderators for expedited action.\n\n### Moderator Action Limits\n- Moderators SHALL be restricted to a maximum of 100 moderation actions per 24-hour period. When this threshold is met, all subsequent moderation attempts SHALL be denied with a notification explaining the cap and a suggestion to seek administrator intervention if required.\n\n### Escalation\n- Escalated moderation cases (in excess of standard caps, or those involving moderator actions on each other) SHALL be routed to administrators, with strict audit and notification.\n\n## Voting and Reputation Rules\n\n### Voting\n- Only members, moderators, and administrators MAY participate in voting. Guests are explicitly barred from all voting action attempts; any such attempts SHALL trigger a request to register or log in.\n- Members SHALL NOT vote on their own posts/comments; any such attempt SHALL return a specific error message.\n- THE system SHALL enforce a one-vote-per-user-per-item policy (no duplicate or ballot stuffing). Voting actions are reversible by the user within 24 hours of the original cast—no further changes allowed thereafter.\n- WHEN an invalid vote is attempted, THE system SHALL deny the action and display a business-rationale-based error message (e.g., \"You cannot vote on your own post. Please participate fairly.\").\n- All voting events SHALL be recorded with user, target content, action (up/down/retraction), and timestamp for audit logging.\n\n### Reputation\n- WHEN a post receives an upvote, THE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL award +10 points to the author’s reputation; comment upvotes award +2. Downvotes on posts result in -2, and comments -1, deducted from author reputation.\n- WHEN a member’s reputation falls below -100, THE system SHALL restrict them from creating new posts/comments until the score returns to or above zero. Affected users SHALL receive an in-system and email notification detailing cause, next steps, and appeal options.\n- IF a content removal appeal is won, THEN THE system SHALL restore any associated lost reputation to the affected user within one hour.\n\n### Reputation Display and Update\n- THE system SHALL display each member’s reputation score on their profile and with all posts/comments for transparency.\n- Reputation changes SHALL occur within 10 seconds of triggering action and display immediately on all relevant user-visible screens.\n\n## Prohibited Content Definition\n\n- THE system SHALL strictly prohibit the inclusion in any post/comment of:\n  1. Hate speech or direct attacks based on group/individual attributes (race, gender, etc.)\n  2. Threats of violence, or incitement to unlawful acts\n  3. Factual misrepresentation intended to mislead (misinformation/disinformation), determined by fact-checking or moderation\n  4. Unsolicited advertising, chain mail, affiliate links, or other spam content\n  5. Sexual/graphic content not contextually relevant to public policy discussion\n  6. Doxxing: publishing personal data (addresses, phone numbers, ID numbers) without explicit, legal consent\n- WHEN prohibited content is detected by automated tools or moderator review, THE system SHALL immediately flag the item, notify affected parties, and log the incident by content ID, involved users, violation type, timestamp, and reviewer.\n- IF a member accumulates three or more prohibited content removals in a 30-day window, THEN THE system SHALL auto-suspend the account for a minimum of 7 days, issuing a notification with actionable recovery/appeal options.\n\n### Prohibited Content Detection Edge Cases\n- IF prohibited content is repetitively submitted by a suspended user, THEN THE system SHALL extend suspension by 7 days for each further violation and lock the ability to message or submit appeals during the extension.\n- WHEN suspected prohibited content is detected with ambiguous evidence, THE system SHALL assign the item to a moderator queue with high priority and prevent publication until a decision is reached.\n- IF content is incorrectly flagged/removed and overturned on appeal, THEN THE system SHALL record the event for bias monitoring and restore all associated penalties to the user account within 24 hours.\n\n## Content Removal and Appeal Process\n\n### Removal Workflow\n- WHEN content is selected for removal (by moderator, admin, or auto-action), THE system SHALL immediately notify the author with explicit reason code, the moderation policy section violated, and clear instructions for appeal.\n- THE system SHALL keep all content removal/deletion operations fully logged, including initiator, approver (if escalated), action timestamp, content snapshot, and subsequent user notification status, for a minimum of 7 years for legal retention.\n- WHEN a deletion request by a member collides with ongoing moderation, moderation review SHALL finish first before deletion is processed.\n\n### Appeal Rights and Flow\n- All members MAY appeal removal or suspension actions within seven days of notification by submitting a formal appeal with explanatory statement and optional supporting evidence.\n- WHEN an appeal is submitted, THE system SHALL assign the case to a moderator/administrator who was not previously involved in the original action, ensure impartiality, and create a formal review record including decision timeline (max 48 hours for appeal response; escalated to 7 days for extraordinary cases).\n- IF an appeal is granted, THEN THE system SHALL reinstate all content and reverse associated penalties/reputation within one hour, notifying the appellant promptly via both in-app and registered email channels.\n- IF an appeal is denied, THEN THE system SHALL purge the content after an additional 30 days but preserve case audit logs. Denials SHALL include rationale and next steps (e.g., further escalation to admin in extreme/bias cases).\n- IF appeals are unresolved after 7 days, THEN THE system SHALL automatically escalate to administrator, flagging for urgent handling.\n\n### Edge Case and Exception Handling\n- IF a user attempts appeal submission after the allowed period (seven days from notification), THEN THE system SHALL refuse the appeal and present a detailed error message with instructions for alternate dispute channels.\n- WHEN duplicate appeals are identified for the same action/outcome, THE system SHALL merge them for singular review and notify the user.\n- IF content deletion is requested by the author during an active appeal, THEN THE system SHALL freeze deletion until the appeal concludes.\n\n## Business Rules Summary Table\n\n| Rule ID | Action                         | Condition                          | Actor        | Limit/Trigger      | Outcome                                 |\n|--------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| BR-01  | Create Post                    | Valid input; within quota          | Member       | 10/day            | Accept or reject                        |\n| BR-02  | Create Comment                 | Valid input; within quota          | Member       | 50/day            | Accept or reject                        |\n| BR-03  | Edit Own Post/Comment          | Within 24hr of submission          | Member       | 24hr              | Else escalate to moderator/admin        |\n| BR-04  | Delete Post/Comment            | Own; within retention period       | Member       | 180 day retention | Public removal, audit retention         |\n| BR-05  | Moderate Post/Comment          | Flagged/violating                  | Moderator    | 100/day           | Edit, delete, log, notify, audit        |\n| BR-06  | Vote on Content                | Not own, not guest, unique/item    | Member+      | 1/item, 24hr undo | Accept, error for invalid               |\n| BR-07  | Auto-Hide/Expedite Review      | 5/20 unique reports in 24hr        | System       | 5–20 reports      | Mask, notify, trigger moderator action  |\n| BR-08  | Suspend for Prohibited Content | 3 removals in 30 days              | System       | 3                 | 7 day auto-suspension                   |\n| BR-09  | Appeal Removal/Suspension      | Act within 7 days                  | Member       | 7 days            | Assign reviewer, respond ≤48hr, resolve |\n\n## Moderation, Removal & Appeal Flow (Mermaid)\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Content Created\"] --> B[\"Flagged by Member or Automated\"]\n  B --> C{\"Report Count>=Threshold?\"}\n  C -->|\"Yes\"| D[\"Auto-Hide Content\"]\n  C -->|\"No\"| E[\"Visible Pending Review\"]\n  D --> F[\"Moderator Review\"]\n  F --> G{\"Violation Confirmed?\"}\n  G -->|\"Yes\"| H[\"Content Removed\"]\n  G -->|\"No\"| I[\"Content Reinstated\"]\n  H --> J[\"User Notified with Reason\"]\n  J --> K{\"Appeal Filed?\"}\n  K -->|\"Yes\"| L[\"Appeal Review by Moderator/Administrator\"]\n  L --> M{\"Appeal Success?\"}\n  M -->|\"Yes\"| I\n  M -->|\"No\"| N[\"Permanent Removal\"]\n  K -->|\"No\"| N\n```\n\n## Enforcement, Auditing, and Updates\n\n- All business rules, validation, moderation, and appeal operations SHALL be enforced automatically by politicalEconomicBoard where possible, with full auditability on every critical action by user, role, time, and action/result.\n- WHEN regulatory or policy changes occur, THE system SHALL update applicable business logic and communicate significant changes to moderators and administrators within 48 hours, ensuring absolute legal compliance.\n- Audit logs, removal records, moderation actions, and appeal reviews SHALL be stored for a minimum of 7 years or as required by applicable regulation.\n\n## References to Related Project Documents\n\n- For high-level platform vision, business model, and KPIs, see the [Service Overview](./01-service-overview.md).\n- For user role structures, authentication flows, and permission matrix, refer to the [User Roles and Authentication Guide](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md).\n- For all business logic requiring implementation, workflows, and scenario coverage, reference the [Functional Requirements Specification](./03-functional-requirements.md).\n\nAll contents herein specify business requirements only.

Browsing Flow","Member Content Contribution Flow","Moderation Workflow","Administrator Oversight Flow","Exception and Error Recovery Scenarios"],"audience":"development team and business stakeholders","detailLevel":"moderate detail","content":"# User Journeys and Scenarios for politicalEconomicBoard\n\n## Guest Browsing Flow\n### Entry and Basic Navigation\n- WHEN a guest visits politicalEconomicBoard, THE system SHALL allow viewing of all public discussions, categories, post lists, and individual threads without requiring authentication.\n- WHEN a guest attempts to access content marked as private, suppressed by moderation, or under disciplinary review, THE system SHALL restrict access and display an explanation referencing access restrictions.\n\n### Interactions\n- WHEN a guest tries to interact—such as commenting, posting, voting, reacting, or reporting—THE system SHALL deny the action and prompt the guest to register or log in.\n- WHEN a guest views post metadata (author names, timestamps, vote counts), THE system SHALL display all information visible to public users except any concealed by moderation or platform policy.\n\n### Edge and Error Handling\n- IF a guest uses a browser with restricted cookies or JavaScript, THEN THE system SHALL display a warning banner indicating certain features may not operate.\n- IF a guest repeatedly attempts denied actions, THEN THE system SHALL limit request rate and present a friendly message preventing abuse of public interfaces.\n- WHEN a guest account is detected to be bot-like (based on behavioral business rules), THE system SHALL temporarily rate limit and notify administrators for review.\n\n## Member Content Contribution Flow\n### Registration and Verification\n- WHEN a user chooses to register, THE system SHALL collect email and password, send a verification email, and restrict posting ability until email is confirmed.\n- WHEN a member completes email verification, THE system SHALL activate posting and interaction privileges.\n\n### Post Creation\n- WHEN a member creates a new post, THE system SHALL validate title (10–100 chars), body (50–10,000 chars), presence of at least one allowed tag, and absence of prohibited content.\n- IF a member attempts to submit content in excess of limits or with forbidden elements, THEN THE system SHALL block submission, display descriptive validation errors, and highlight the offending field.\n- WHEN a post submission is valid, THE system SHALL associate the post with the author, set visibility to public (unless auto-flagged), and deliver confirmation instantly.\n- IF the post triggers automated moderation or external moderation check, THEN THE system SHALL hold the post in a pending state, inform the member, and update on status resolution.\n\n### Commenting and Voting\n- WHEN a member reads posts, THE system SHALL allow adding comments on any unlocked thread in accordance with rules (length, quota).\n- WHEN a member votes or reacts to posts/comments, THE system SHALL update the display in real-time and prevent multiple votes per item.\n- IF a member attempts to vote on own content or vote more than once, THEN THE system SHALL display a specific error preventing the action.\n\n### Editing and Deleting Own Content\n- WHEN a member edits or deletes their own post/comment, THE system SHALL allow changes only within the specified 24-hour (posts) or 12-hour (comments) windows and verify authorship.\n- IF a member attempts to edit after this period, THEN THE system SHALL deny the action and provide a business-rationale message.\n\n### Reporting Content\n- WHEN a member reports any post or comment, THE system SHALL log the report with reason code, notify moderators immediately, and display a confirmation to the reporting user.\n- WHEN the reported item’s severity threshold is reached (per business rule), THE system SHALL auto-hide it pending moderation review.\n\n### Profile and Preferences\n- WHEN a member updates profile data (display name, bio, photo), THE system SHALL validate input and apply changes instantly.\n- IF a member attempts to upload an invalid image or perform restricted updates, THEN THE system SHALL provide actionable error feedback.\n\n### Edge Cases and Recovery\n- IF member’s account is suspended, THEN THE system SHALL immediately block content contribution, notify the member with reason and appeal instructions.\n- IF the member fails to verify email within 48 hours, THEN THE system SHALL resend the activation link with periodic reminders until action or opt-out.\n- IF technical failure or downtime interrupts a submission, THEN THE system SHALL auto-save draft and allow retry post-recovery.\n\n## Moderation Workflow\n### Report Review and Decision-Making\n- WHEN a content report is submitted, THE system SHALL notify moderators with full report and content details in a consolidated, prioritized dashboard.\n- WHEN a moderator opens a reported item, THE system SHALL present content, prior moderation actions, report reason codes, and voting history.\n- WHEN a moderator reviews content, THE system SHALL provide decision options: dismiss, edit, delete, escalate, or restrict.\n- IF report volume on an item reaches the auto-hide threshold, THEN THE system SHALL immediately mask the content from public view pending review.\n- WHEN a moderation action is taken (edit/delete/restrict), THE system SHALL log rationale, record action for audit, and notify content author and reporting members.\n\n### Role Boundaries and Escalation\n- WHEN a moderator encounters a case that exceeds their authority (such as suspected criminal content or major policy breach), THE system SHALL escalate the case to an administrator and restrict further actions to view-only until resolution.\n- WHEN a member is temporarily suspended by a moderator, THE system SHALL log the suspension, timestamp, and justification, and restrict only posting/commenting access (not appeals or browsing).\n\n### Moderator Quotas and Fairness\n- THE system SHALL enforce daily moderation limits per moderator to avoid bias and burnout (per business rule: 100 actions/day).\n- WHEN two or more moderators attempt simultaneous action on the same content, THE system SHALL serialize the operation, apply the first-completed decision, and inform all involved moderators of the outcome.\n\n### Complex Content Moderation and Appeal Flow (Mermaid)\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Member Reports Content\"] --> B[\"Moderator Reviews Report\"]\n  B -->

K[\"Dismiss Report\"]\n  K --> E\n```\n\n### Edge and Error Scenarios\n- IF a moderator incorrectly applies an action, THEN THE system SHALL provide a correction path (appeal or reversal) and log all revisions for audit.\n- IF system detects abnormal moderation patterns (volume, bias), THEN THE system SHALL alert administrators for review.\n- WHEN moderation service or platform is under outage, THE system SHALL queue all new reports for later review and inform reporters and content owners of possible delays.\n\n## Administrator Oversight Flow\n### User and Role Management\n- WHEN an administrator receives an escalation, THE system SHALL display all associated case data and decision logs.\n- WHEN managing users and roles (promote, demote, suspend, revoke), THE system SHALL audit all actions and update permissions instantly.\n- WHEN an administrator changes platform settings or critical business rules (e.g., quotas, moderation thresholds), THE system SHALL log and timestamp changes, notifying all moderators.\n- WHEN an administrator reviews appeals escalated from moderators, THE system SHALL deliver a final, binding decision and communicate outcome to all parties within a set SLA (e.g., 48 hours).\n- WHEN platform abuse or coordinated attacks are detected, THE system SHALL empower administrators to trigger enhanced security, temporarily restrict new registrations, or activate emergency communication flows.\n\n### Audit, Compliance, and Recovery\n- THE system SHALL provide administrators with full access to audit logs, suspension/reinstatement histories, moderation patterns, and system configuration changes.\n- WHEN compliance monitoring is invoked, THE system SHALL generate comprehensive records that link user actions to audit trails.\n- WHEN system errors or policy ambiguities arise, THE system SHALL empower administrators to clarify rules, communicate updates, and provide documented guidance to all user roles.\n\n### Administrator Error, Escalation, and Performance\n- IF multiple unresolved cases persist beyond the SLA, THEN THE system SHALL auto-prioritize them and alert senior administration.\n- IF a disputed suspension or removal is reversed on appeal, THEN THE system SHALL restore all affected user privileges and content (unless otherwise barred by legal or policy constraint).\n- WHEN administrator actions result in platform-level changes, THE system SHALL display change notifications on all user dashboards and maintain history for at least 12 months.\n\n## Exception and Error Recovery Scenarios\n### Authentication and Access Failures\n- WHEN any user (of any role) supplies incorrect credentials, THE system SHALL display a standardized, secure error message within 2 seconds without revealing sensitive details.\n- WHEN a member’s session expires, THE system SHALL block all protected actions and provide a prompt for re-authentication.\n- IF system identifies attempted access to unauthorized areas, THEN THE system SHALL log the event and suggest correct pathways or role upgrade (where applicable).\n\n### Content Submission and Save/Retry Paths\n- WHEN post or comment submissions fail due to server or network outages, THE system SHALL auto-save a local draft and provide a retry option upon next connection.\n- IF validation fails on content submission, THEN THE system SHALL provide field-specific, actionable feedback and allow the user to correct and re-submit.\n- WHEN rate limits or quotas are exceeded, THE system SHALL prevent further submissions, indicate remaining cooldown time, and display a quota usage summary.\n\n### Moderation and Appeal Edge Cases\n- WHEN a content author disputes removal/editing by moderation or administration, THE system SHALL provide an appeals interface, confirm receipt, and display expected review timelines.\n- WHEN appeals are found to be valid, THE system SHALL restore content or privileges and reverse penalties immediately.\n- IF system detects possible error or bias in moderation, THEN THE system SHALL automatically escalate for secondary review by unaffiliated moderator or administrator.\n\n### System Downtime and Recovery\n- WHEN planned maintenance or outage is scheduled, THE system SHALL notify all affected parties in advance and display real-time system status updates.\n- WHEN system downtime exceeds 10 minutes, THE system SHALL

business logic exceptions, and recovery pathways, ensuring a robust and user-friendly experience in adverse conditions.","filename":"06-error-handling-and-edge-cases.md","documentType":"requirement","outline":["Authentication and Authorization Failures","Content Submission Errors","Moderation Disputes","System Downtime Handling","User Appeal and Resolution Flows"],"audience":"backend developers and support staff","detailLevel":"detailed specification","content":"# Error Handling and Edge Cases for politicalEconomicBoard\n\nComprehensive business requirements for error handling, business logic exceptions, and robust recovery pathways across all user roles (guest, member, moderator, administrator) are detailed for the politicalEconomicBoard platform. No technical implementation instructions are given; backend developers have complete autonomy to realize these business needs. All requirements use the EARS format and are targeted at backend business process logic, ensuring clarity, fairness, and transparency under all failure, dispute, and edge conditions.\n\n## Introduction\n\nEffective error handling safeguards integrity, trust, and engagement on the politicalEconomicBoard. Proactive and transparent responses to adverse conditions maintain platform reliability, protect user experience, and reinforce fair community governance.\n\nUser roles included:\n- guest: non-logged-in visitor (read only)\n- member: registered participant (post, comment, vote, react, report)\n- moderator: review, intervene, apply community guidelines, manage reports\n- administrator: highest oversight, govern user management, escalated disputes, platform configuration, audit access\n\nNo business rule, user workflow, or error scenario is omitted.\n\n## Authentication and Authorization Failures\n\n### Failure Scenarios and Triggers\n- Wrong credentials (password, email)\n- Expired, malformed, or revoked tokens (JWT, session, refresh)\n- Insufficient role for attempted resource/action\n- Session expiration or forced logout (manual, policy, admin-initiated, inactivity)\n- Lockout due to excessive login failures or account breach\n- Simultaneous conflicting logins\n- MFA (multi-factor authentication) errors (e.g., expired/invalid OTP)\n- Guest or member hit with escalated security events (suspicion, IP bans)\n- Communication failure in password reset/email verification\n- Unauthorized or revoked access after role downgrade or suspension\n\n### EARS Requirements\n- WHEN a user submits invalid credentials, THE system SHALL deny login, giving a clear, instant reason without specifying which credential failed.\n- WHEN an access or refresh token is expired, malformed, or revoked, THE system SHALL prompt re-authentication and display a message without revealing technical details.\n- WHEN a guest or under-privileged user attempts restricted/role-based actions, THE system SHALL deny the attempt, explicitly state the permission required, and suggest next steps (registration, contact support).\n- WHILE an account is locked, suspended, or banned, THE system SHALL prohibit login and indicate the status, including the reason and duration if applicable.\n- IF an account or resource is compromised or under threat (e.g., repeated failed logins, MFA failure), THEN THE system SHALL restrict further attempts for no less than 15 minutes and notify the user via registered channel (email/SMS) if provided.\n- WHEN authentication fails due to external system (email, SMS, SSO) error, THE system SHALL explain the failure and provide alternative recovery or retry guidance.\n- WHEN a user attempts password reset with an expired or previously used reset link, THE system SHALL inform of expiration and provide an immediate option to request a new link.\n- WHEN a user's session expires (policy, admin, or token age), THE system SHALL redirect user to login and preserve intended action (if possible) after success.\n- WHEN a role is downgraded or permissions revoked (by admin or policy), THE system SHALL revoke tokens and log out user, displaying a clear explanation upon next interaction.\n- IF conflicting parallel sessions are detected for a single account, THEN THE system SHALL invalidate all or latest sessions as per policy and notify user via preferred channel.\n\n### Recovery and Communication\n- THE system SHALL provide contextual, actionable recovery (retry, contact, password reset) for each auth failure, always within 2 seconds of the event.\n- User-facing error messages SHALL avoid leaking sensitive technical info or security state.\n- All lockouts, escalated security actions, and forced session terminations SHALL be auditable and have a full user notification workflow.\n\n#### Examples:\n- WHEN a member makes 5 failed login attempts in under 10 minutes, THE system SHALL enforce a 15-minute lockout, display a clear lockout reason, and send a notification email with further instructions.\n- IF a guest attempts to vote, comment, or report, THEN THE system SHALL respond with \"Registration required\" and a link to registration page.\n\n## Content Submission Errors\n\n### Error Scenarios\n- Submission with invalid input (empty required fields, too short/long, wrong format)\n- Input of prohibited content (hate speech, banned tags, blocklisted URLs), flagged by business rule or moderation algorithm\n- Attempt to upload unsupported file types, oversized files, or incomplete/failed uploads\n- Simultaneous duplicate post/comment submission (caused by repeat clicking or network non-idempotency)\n- Posting adult/prohibited content, media that fails scanning\n- Violating posting/comment frequency/quota\n- Editing a stale or deleted resource (post/comment)\n- Network/timeout or race condition producing uncertain state (e.g., content appears to fail but is published)\n\n### EARS Requirements\n- WHEN a user submits invalid content, THE system SHALL return an instant error highlighting the specific field, maximum/minimum allowed, and the correction required.\n- WHEN content submission triggers a business rule (e.g., prohibited words, banned media), THE system SHALL block the action, redact sensitive inputs from error display, and specify which business policy was violated.\n- WHEN a file upload fails (unsupported type, size limit, incomplete), THE system SHALL provide allowed formats, size info, and a retry option.\n- IF a user attempts a duplicate submission (same content/comment/post within 10 seconds), THEN THE system SHALL save only the first valid entry, reject duplicates, and provide a message advising patience.\n- WHEN the user exceeds their posting, voting, or upload quota, THE system SHALL display a summary of remaining quota, lock further attempts, and specify when limits reset.\n- WHEN a member attempts to edit a deleted or stale post/comment, THE system SHALL refuse the edit, inform of current item state, and suggest new content creation instead.\n- WHEN network issues or platform instability cause an ambiguous save/failure, THE system SHALL show clear status, auto-retry once (if possible), and provide user a way to verify publication state.\n\n### Recovery and User Guidance\n- THE system SHALL always allow a user to correct and resubmit after a failed attempt, giving actionable guidance and not discarding valid input fields unnecessarily.\n- THE system SHALL respond to every failed submission or validation error within 2 seconds under typical load.\n- Edge case: IF multiple users edit or submit the same resource simultaneously, THEN THE system SHALL enforce last-write-wins or resolve via explicit conflict UI, never discarding changes silently.\n\n#### Examples:\n- WHEN a member tries to attach a 20MB PDF (5MB file size limit), THE system SHALL reject with \"File too large—maximum allowed is 5MB.\"\n- IF a member posts content with a banned phrase, THEN THE system SHALL block submission, mark the specific policy violated, and allow editing.\n\n## Moderation Disputes\n\n### Dispute Scenarios\n- Member disputes moderator/administrator removal or editing of their content\n- Reported content challenged by owner, including claims of policy ambiguity, bias, or system error\n- Perception or evidence of moderator/admin overreach, mistakes, or inconsistent enforcement\n- Simultaneous/conflicting mod actions, lost logs, race conditions\n\n### EARS Requirements\n- WHEN moderation action (removal, edit, restriction) is taken on user content, THE system SHALL notify the affected user within 2 seconds, giving specific cause and a link or reference to the violated guideline.\n- WHEN a user files a moderation appeal, THE system SHALL immediately acknowledge receipt, provide a unique case/tracking number, and estimate a target resolution time (e.g., “within 72 hours”).\n- WHEN an appeal is submitted, THE system SHALL assign it to a reviewer not involved in the original action, except in cases only the administrator can resolve.\n- IF system or reviewer error is discovered upon appeal (e.g., wrong policy applied, mistaken identity), THEN THE system SHALL promptly restore the item, reverse penalties, update the audit log, and notify all impacted parties.\n- WHEN an appeal is complex or ambiguous, THE system SHALL escalate to administrator review, documenting rationale for process transparency.\n- THE system SHALL support simultaneous or serial appeals, preserving full audit record for every decision/override.\n- WHEN two or more moderators initiate conflicting actions on the same item concurrently, THE system SHALL block subsequent action and require coordinated resolution, logging both attempts for transparency.\n- All notification steps, logs, and resolutions SHALL be visible to the affected user in their dashboard under “Appeals and Moderation History.”\n\n### Performance, Transparency, and User Support\n- THE system SHALL complete initial disputed moderation notifications and case filings instantly (within 2 seconds); review and resolution times SHALL conform to business standards (e.g., appeals resolved within 72 hours, bans within 24 hours).\n- THE system SHALL notify users promptly (email or in-app) of all status changes, resolutions, or escalations in moderation/appeal cases.\n\n#### Example:\n- WHEN a moderator deletes a member’s post for policy violation, THE system SHALL send the member an in-app alert and email (if permitted), stating reason and reference ID. If the author appeals, THE system SHALL immediately log the appeal, send confirmation and estimated timeline.\n\n## System Downtime Handling\n\n### Failure Scenarios and Triggers\n- Scheduled maintenance with full/partial service interruption\n- Unexpected server, network, or dependency outage\n- Partial performance degradation detected by system health monitors\n- High-traffic surges causing denial of service or rate limiting\n- Delayed or failed notifications due to infrastructure problems\n- Recovered downtime with queued/auto-processed operations\n\n### EARS Requirements\n- WHEN planned downtime is detected or scheduled, THE system SHALL present a prominent notice to all users, specifying expected duration, reason, and support contact details, at least 72 hours in advance.\n- WHEN unexpected downtime occurs, THE system SHALL instantaneously switch to a business-branded status/error page giving an estimate for restoration and alternate support channels.\n- IF degraded performance or partial outage is detected (by system monitors), THEN THE system SHALL display a persistent status banner on all pages for all roles, naming affected features and probable ETA.\n- DURING downtime, THE system SHALL queue all user submissions (posts, comments, reports, votes) where feasible and automatically process or reject them once services are restored, per business rule. Denied actions SHALL be explained after service returns.\n- THE system SHALL provide persistent access to help documentation and error recovery advice to all users, even during service interruptions where technically feasible.\n- WHEN downtime exceeds 10 minutes, THE system SHALL send real-time status emails to all members, moderators, and administrators notifying updates and post-mortem links upon restoration.\n- THE system SHALL log and retain a full downtime incident record, including time, cause, impact area, user-affected transactions, attempted recoveries, and all notifications sent.\n\n### Edge Case Recovery and Communication\n- IF downtime or degraded mode recurs within a rolling 24-hour window, THEN THE system SHALL escalate notification urgency, switch to alternate support processes, and inform all users of persistent incident.\n- WHERE approvals, appeals, or critical deadlines are missed due to downtime, THE system SHALL extend due times and notify affected users.\n\n#### Example:\n- WHEN a report submission is queued during a 1-hour outage, THE system SHALL notify the user of queuing status, send email on restore, and process the report as if submitted at the original attempted timestamp.\n\n## User Appeal and Resolution Flows\n\n### Scenarios\n- Appeals of content removals/edits, user bans, mistaken actions, ambiguous or unclear policy complaints, repeat appeals of same event\n- Late or retroactive appeals after deadline missed due to technical fault\n- Multiple-stage, compound appeal/escalation including arbitration by admin\n\n### EARS Requirements\n- WHEN a user files an appeal, THE system SHALL generate a receipt, a unique tracking ID, and summary of next steps with timelines.\n- WHEN an appeal is eligible, THE system SHALL commit to business maximum review time: 72 hours for standard cases, 24 hours for bans, up to 3 business days if new evidence is submitted.\n- WHERE deadline extensions are triggered (e.g., downtime, new evidence), THE system SHALL inform user of revised expected resolution and reason.\n- IF appeal escalation to an administrator is required (policy ambiguity, moderator conflict, high-risk case), THEN THE system SHALL hand off and notify all parties of new reviewer, rationale, and expected timeline.\n- WHEN an appeal is resolved (approved, denied, or revised), THE system SHALL immediately clear the dashboard notification, send message(s) to the user, summarize the outcome, and reference further appeal or complaint actions if available.\n- THE system SHALL log all appeals, escalation steps, status changes, deadlines, and every notification for audit.\n- IF a member, moderator, or admin submits multiple appeals on a single event, THEN THE system SHALL allow only the first through but respond to subsequent attempts with current status and audit reference.\n\n### User Experience and Feedback\n- All appeal status and related communication SHALL be accessible to the user under a dedicated “Appeals & Resolution History” interface.\n- THE system SHALL capture user satisfaction feedback optionally after each resolved appeal.\n\n#### Example:\n- WHEN a member appeals a ban and submits additional evidence within 48 hours, THE system SHALL extend admin review window by up to 1 further business day and record the reason for extension. On decision, THE system SHALL send a detailed outcome summary including next appeal options.\n\n## Edge Case Catalog\n\n| Edge Case Scenario | Role(s) Involved | EARS Requirement | Additional Business Result |\n|--------------------|------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Simultaneous identical submissions | Member | IF multiple identical submissions within 10 seconds, THEN THE system SHALL accept only the first and reject others with error. | Log all attempts, show status in user history. |\n| Guest accesses member-only voting | Guest | WHEN a guest votes, THE system SHALL deny and invite to register. | Track frequency for abuse prevention. |\n| Member edits deleted post/comment | Member | IF an edit to a non-existent/deleted item, THEN THE system SHALL block, indicate deletion, lock edit UI. | Suggest new content creation, flag for user review. |\n| Overlapping mod actions | Moderator | IF two moderators act on same item within 5 seconds, THEN THE system SHALL block second, notify both. | Log incident for audit, trigger reconciliation workflow. |\n| Expired password reset link | Any | IF a reset link is expired/used, THEN THE system SHALL display expiration and prompt request for new link. | Log for security audit, notify upon multiple failures. |\n| Moderator disputes admin removal | Moderator | WHEN moderator appeals admin action, THE system SHALL auto-escalate to administrator. | Provide admin’s rationale, preserve full moderation log. |\n| Member account over post quota | Member | WHEN quota exceeded (posts, files), THE system SHALL block new submissions, show quota summary. | Email warning to member, notify admin on abuse threshold. |\n| Repeated MFA or security failures | Any with MFA | IF 3+ consecutive MFA failures, THEN THE system SHALL lock account and notify user/admin. | Require manual verification before unlock. |\n| Prolonged downtime affecting deadlines | All | IF downtime or degraded mode causes missed appeal/deadline, THEN THE system SHALL extend deadline and notify involved users. | Post-mortem sent post recovery. |\n| Race condition on resource deletion | All | IF resource is deleted mid-edit/post, THEN THE system SHALL reject save and alert user to resource state. | Log conflict, provide recovery advice. |\n\n## Performance Expectations for Error Recovery\n\n- THE system SHALL deliver any error or validation response for user actions within 2 seconds under standard operating conditions; <5 seconds under heavy load.\n- All error and failure events SHALL be logged with timestamp, user, action, input, and business rule triggered.\n- No user data loss permitted except where business rules mandate failure; all recoverable transaction attempts SHALL be persisted for retry.\n- DURING rollback/recovery, THE system SHALL maintain data consistency and notify all affected users of content state, action taken, and available resolution.\n- Notification delivery for appeals or escalation SHALL occur instantly (≤2 seconds), failing which THE system SHALL trigger retries and escalate non-delivery to manual support within 30 minutes.\n\n## Diagrams\n\n### General Error Handling and Workflow (Mermaid - LR)\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"User Action Trigger\"\n    A[\"User Initiates Action\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Validation&Auth\"\n    B[\"System Validates Input\"]\n    C{\"Is Input Valid?\"}\n    D{\"Is User Authorized?\"}\n  end\n  subgraph \"Error&Handling\"\n    E[\"Show Validation Error(s)\"]\n    F[\"Show Authorization Error\"]\n    G[\"Log Error Event\"]\n    H[\"Prompt Correction/Appeal\"]\n    I[\"Auto-Retry on Unclear Status\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Normal Processing\"\n    J[\"Proceed to Business Logic\"]\n    K[\"Success or Additional Step\"]\n  end\n  A --> B\n  B --> C\n  C -->|\"No\"| E\n  C -->|\"Yes\"| D\n  D -->|\"No\"| F\n  D -->|\"Yes\"| J\n  E --> G\n  F --> G\n  E --> H\n  F --> H\n  H --> I\n  I --> C\n  J --> K\n```\n\n### Moderation Appeal and Escalation Flow\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Appeal Submission\"\n    A[\"User Submits Appeal\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Moderation Review\"\n    B[\"Acknowledge Receipt\"]\n    C[\"Assign Reviewer (Uninvolved)\"]\n    D{\"Is Decision Clear?\"}\n    E{\"Needs Escalation?\"}\n  end\n  subgraph \"Administrator Escalation\"\n    F[\"Admin Review\"]\n    G[\"Record Admin Rationale\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Resolution\"\n    H[\"Notify User Outcome\"]\n    I[\"Update Audit & History\"]\n  end\n  A --> B\n  B --> C\n  C --> D\n  D -->|\"Yes\"| H\n  D -->|\"No\"| E\n  E -->|\"No\"| H\n  E -->|\"Yes\"| F\n  F --> G\n  G --> H\n  H --> I\n```\n\n## References\n\n- For detailed user role, authentication, and permission requirements, see the [User Roles and Authentication Requirements Document](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md).\n- Comprehensive business rules and validation requirements are in the [Business Rules and Validation Logic](./04-business-rules.md).\n- Full functional flows and response expectations are in the [Functional Requirements Specification](./03-functional-requirements.md).\n- Non-functional recovery and monitoring details are in the [Non-Functional Platform Requirements](./07-non-functional-requirements.md).\n"},{"reason":"To describe non-functional requirements impacting performance, scalability, availability, and usability, as well as privacy and compliance considerations.","filename":"07-non-functional-requirements.md","documentType":"requirement","outline":["Performance Expectations","Scalability Requirements","Availability Targets","Data Privacy and Compliance","Accessibility Considerations"],"audience":"development team and compliance officers","detailLevel":"detailed specification","content":"### Introduction and Scope\nThis document defines the complete non-functional requirements for the 'politicalEconomicBoard', ensuring robust performance, reliable scalability, continuous availability, strict data privacy, full legal compliance, and equitable accessibility. These requirements apply to all provided user roles (guest, member, moderator, administrator) and focus on business and user needs in natural language, guiding backend developers to deliver an implementation that fulfills operational, legal, and reputational standards.\n\n## Performance Expectations\n\n### System Responsiveness\n- WHEN a guest, member, moderator, or administrator requests any page or content, THE system SHALL respond and load said content within 2 seconds under normal operating conditions.\n- WHEN a member submits a post or comment, THE system SHALL confirm acceptance and display the new content to the user within 1 second unless content moderation workflow is triggered.\n- WHEN a moderator or administrator requests moderation-related content or reports, THE system SHALL present all relevant data within 2 seconds during standard operating loads.\n- IF user actions exceed expected response times, THEN THE system SHALL notify the user with a clear message and automatically retry the request up to two times before providing an error recovery path.\n\n### Throughput and Latency\n- THE system SHALL support a minimum of 1,000 concurrent active users with no degradation in performance.\n- THE system SHALL be capable of processing up to 500 content submissions (posts/comments/votes/reactions/reports) per minute with average latency below 1.5 seconds per operation.\n- WHERE temporary bursts of activity occur (e.g., coordinated event discussion), THE system SHALL absorb at least a 3x normal traffic spike for up to 10 minutes without critical failure or loss of user data.\n\n### Peak Load Considerations\n- WHEN scheduled events or political/economic news peaks are anticipated, THE system SHALL be ready to operate at double average traffic levels for at least 1 hour.\n- IF capacity is exceeded, THEN THE system SHALL prioritize member, moderator, and administrator actions over guest requests, where permissible by business rules.\n\n#### Mermaid Diagram: Non-Functional Load Flow\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Normal Operation\"] --> B[\"Traffic Spike Detected\"]\n  B -->|\"Within 3x Capacity\"| C[\"Sustain Full Performance\"]\n  B -->|\"Exceeds

Recover\"]\n```\n\n## Scalability Requirements\n\n- THE system SHALL be scalable to accommodate up to 100,000 registered members, supporting a proportional increase in content, moderation actions, and reporting events without degradation in user experience.\n- WHERE growth in geographic diversity occurs, THE system SHALL ensure that average response times for any user role remain below 3 seconds for users world-wide under nominal load conditions.\n- WHEN data storage approaches 80% of projected annual volume, THE system SHALL enable seamless expansion, with no more than 1 hour of planned maintenance affecting non-critical (guest-only) read access.\n\n## Availability Targets\n\n- THE system SHALL maintain at least 99.95% uptime per quarter, measured as availability to members, moderators, and administrators.\n- WHERE planned maintenance is required, THE system SHALL provide at least 72 hours advance notice to all users, with maintenance windows scheduled to minimize impact based on user activity analytics.\n- IF unexpected downtime occurs, THEN THE system SHALL display a business-branded error page with clear recovery expectations and an estimate for service restoration.\n- THE system SHALL support full recovery to the last consistent state within 10 minutes after critical failure.\n- WHERE occur regional outages, THE system SHALL redirect users to a status page displaying ongoing incident information and alternate channels for urgent support (for moderators and administrators).\n\n#### Mermaid Diagram: Uptime & Recovery Flow\n```mermaid\ngraph

GDPR and local data privacy regulations relevant to target user geographies.\n- WHEN a member, moderator, or administrator updates their personal data, THE system SHALL immediately reflect those changes across all stored records and audit logs.\n- WHEN a user requests deletion of their account and data, THE system SHALL irreversibly remove personal data within 7 days, except data required for legal compliance or community business records (as detailed in legal references).\n- WHERE user consent is needed for data collection or analytics, THE system SHALL present a consent mechanism at first interaction and honor subsequent revocation requests without impairing basic service access (when possible).\n- IF unintentional exposure of personal data occurs, THEN THE system SHALL notify affected users and regulatory authorities within 72 hours of discovery, and provide a transparent remediation plan.\n- THE system SHALL enforce data retention limits of 7 years for all policy/audit logs and 2 years for routine content (posts, comments, reactions, reports), unless stricter requirements apply locally.\n\n### Data Privacy Table\n| Data Type       | Retention Duration | Erasable by User | Compliance Standard             |\n|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Personal Info   | 7 years max       | Yes              | GDPR/Local Regulation           |\n| Content         | 2 years           | Yes (by owner)   | Platform Policy                 |\n| Audit Logs      | 7 years           | No               | Legal Requirement               |\n| Moderation Data | Until resolution  | N/A              | Community Compliance            |\n\n## Accessibility Considerations\n\n- THE system SHALL support accessibility in accordance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards for all user-facing interactions, regardless of role.\n- WHEN a guest, member, moderator, or administrator uses assistive technology, THE system SHALL ensure full navigation, basic content interaction, and participation in discussions without functional barriers.\n- WHERE new features are deployed, THE system SHALL include accessibility assessment as part of the launch business criteria.\n- THE system SHALL provide a method for users to report accessibility issues, which SHALL be acknowledged within 48 hours and resolved within 30 days.\n- THE system SHALL support localized experience (EN-US first, future support for other languages) for all content and notifications, with correct formatting for dates, times, and currency symbols where relevant.\n\n## Success Criteria and Measurement\n\n- THE system SHALL be continuously monitored against all non-functional KPIs:\n   - Average response time <2 seconds\n   - Uptime >=99.95%\n   - Successful user deletion compliance rate >=99.99%\n   - Accessibility issue resolution SLA <30 days\n- KPIs SHALL be reviewed quarterly and inform ongoing business investment and operational improvement decisions.\n\n## Cross-Cutting Concerns & Edge Cases\n\n- WHEN exceptional spikes occur outside predicted schedules (e.g., news-driven surges), THE system SHALL prioritize core business functions (content submission, moderation, legal compliance) over non-essential processes (bulk exports).\n- IF disaster events (e.g., major datacenter failures, legal injunctions) disrupt normal operations, THEN THE system SHALL enable rapid failover to a backup region, with maximal loss of 10 minutes of activity data.\n- THE system SHALL provide clear error messaging and self-serve recovery paths for all user roles whenever a non-functional threshold is breached, including links to more information and support.\n\n---\n\nThis document specifies only business requirements for

Introduction\n\n### 1.1 Scope and Objective\n\nTHE politicalEconomicBoard SHALL integrate with external services to fulfill business requirements for content moderation, analytics and reporting, notification delivery (email, SMS, etc.), and, where necessary, optional single sign-on (SSO) for enterprise or institutional access. Every integration SHALL preserve seamless user experience, system security, full scalability, and regulatory/data compliance for all defined user roles.\n\nTHE system SHALL state WHAT integrations must deliver in business and user terms; technical, API, or implementation-level details SHALL be at the discretion of developers.\n\n### 1.2 Integration Principles\n\nTHE system SHALL ensure all integrations:\n- Support a seamless and transparent user experience, with no perceptible workflow disruption.\n- Adhere to all legal privacy, security, and company policy requirements for third-party data exchanges.\n- Scale with community, ensuring performance for guest, member, moderator, and administrator at all activity levels.\n- Comply with statutory, regulatory, and internal controls for audit readiness and business continuity.\n\nDetails about compliance and operational baselines are in the [Non-Functional Requirements and Compliance Documentation](./07-non-functional-requirements.md).\n\n## 2. Third-Party Moderation Integration\n\n### 2.1 Moderation Workflow Requirements\n\nWHEN a member submits any post or comment, THE system SHALL submit the content for automated moderation via a third-party service. THE system SHALL not publish content until moderation is complete, except for drafts explicitly saved by users.\n\nWHEN a moderator or administrator reviews member-reported content, THE system SHALL display moderation analysis and recommendations from the external moderation provider as primary evidence for decision-making.\n\nWHEN the external moderation is inconclusive, delayed, or returns an error, THE system SHALL queue the content for prioritized human review by moderators, marking it as \"pending moderation\" to all user roles.\n\n### 2.2 Business Rules for Content Handling\n\nTHE system SHALL block publication of content assigned \"high-risk\" or \"prohibited\" status by the moderation provider.\n\nWHEN content is flagged as \"questionable,\" THE system SHALL display a status of \"manual review required\" and notify moderators to act within the next available review cycle.\n\nTHE system SHALL always notify the member creator when their submission is delayed, flagged, blocked, or otherwise affected by moderation.\n\nWHEN a moderator acts on third-party flagged content, THE system SHALL record the decision and notification trail for audit.\n\n### 2.3 Decision and Escalation Logic\n\nIF moderation service response time is above 8 seconds, THEN THE system SHALL provide an immediate message to the content creator, stating the content is \"pending review,\" with the option to save as a draft, and SHALL not lose any user input.\n\nWHEN third-party moderation is unavailable or fails, THE system SHALL enable queuing of new submissions, clearly informing users that moderation is delayed and providing expected time for review.\n\nWHEN an automated moderation result is disputed, challenged, or appealed by a member, THE system SHALL record the appeal, assign it for moderator attention, and inform users about expected handling timelines and escalation logic.\n\n### 2.4 Error and Exception Scenarios\n\nIF third-party moderation returns an error, timeout, or inconclusive result, THEN THE system SHALL:\n- not publish or delete content automatically;\n- place it in a system-held \"pending\" state visible only to its author, moderators, and administrators;\n- require explicit moderator decision before publication or rejection.\n\nWHEN moderation results are missing or delayed, THE system SHALL maintain submission state indefinitely or until a moderator takes action.\n\n### 2.5 Performance and Response Expectations\n\nTHE system SHALL process and return moderation status for typical post/comment submissions under 2000 characters within 8 seconds for 95% of cases. WHEN processing delays exceed 8 seconds, THE system SHALL clearly notify the user with precise reason and next steps.\n\nWHEN moderation decisions are outstanding for more than 1 hour, THE system SHALL escalate to moderators directly and provide administrators with system-level performance reports.\n\n### 2.6 Role-based Access and Triggers\n\n- Only member, moderator, and administrator submissions invoke moderation integration; guest browsing actions SHALL never trigger moderation flows.\n- Moderators and administrators SHALL access detailed moderation data (result scores, test links, vendor comments) for informed review; members can view only moderation status and resolution of their own content.\n- WHEN manual review is needed, THE system SHALL notify the next-available moderator and, if delayed more than 4 hours, escalate to administrators.\n\n### 2.7 Moderation Integration Flow Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Member Submits Content\"] --> B[\"Send to Moderation Service\"]\n  B --> C{\"Moderation Result\"}\n  C -->|\"Approved\"| D[\"Publish Content\"]\n  C -->|\"High Risk\"| E[\"Block Content, Notify User\"]\n  C -->|\"Questionable\"| F[\"Queue for Manual Moderator Review\"]\n  C -->|\"Error/Timeout\"| G[\"Mark Pending, Notify Moderator\"]\n  F --> H[\"Moderator Review\"]\n  H --> I{\"Final Decision\"}\n  I -->|\"Approve\"| D\n  I -->|\"Block\"| E\n```\n\n## 3. Analytics and Reporting Integration\n\n### 3.1 Business Needs for Analytics\n\nTHE system SHALL integrate an analytics solution capable of:\n- measuring DAU/MAU (Daily/Monthly Active Users) with role-based segmentation; \n- reporting most viewed topics, prolific contributors, and high-engagement content;\n- tracking post/comment/reaction/flag rates;\n- measuring moderation workflow duration (from report to resolution);\n- calculating user retention, churn, ban, and appeal metrics for continuous business analysis.\n\n### 3.2 Data Collection Rules\n\nWHEN users interact with any of: post/comment creation, voting/reactions, reporting, login/logout, THE system SHALL enqueue and transmit anonymized event data to the analytics service with accurate timestamps, role, and content context. No personally identifiable information (PII) SHALL be sent to analytics providers.\n\nWHERE PII or pseudonymized data transmission is required for business reporting, THE system SHALL encrypt and minimize data in compliance with [Non-Functional Requirements and Compliance Documentation](./07-non-functional-requirements.md).\n\n### 3.3 Reporting Processes\n\nAdmins and product managers SHALL configure dashboards and schedule both recurring and ad-hoc reports containing pre-defined and customizable business metrics. Scheduled analytics SHALL be available as downloadable reports and/or via periodic email/SMS summaries.\n\nWHEN traffic spikes, potential spam attacks, or moderation bottlenecks are detected through analytics, THE system SHALL trigger immediate alerts and dashboards to be sent to responsible roles (moderators, administrators, support staff).\n\n### 3.4 Data Privacy and Security\n\nTHE system SHALL transmit only pseudonymized or aggregated data externally as per legal requirements; consent mechanisms and opt-out flows SHALL be available per data privacy policy.\n\nWHEN a user revokes analytics consent, THE system SHALL cease event forwarding for non-mandatory actions, logging consent status and enforcement automatically.\n\n### 3.5 Performance/Reactivity Criteria\n\nTHE system SHALL transmit analytics events in asynchronous batches or streams, ensuring no user-visible delay in foreground system performance. WHEN event queue backlogs or failures are detected, THE system SHALL notify system administrators within 1 minute and log all outage and recovery attempts for audit purposes.\n\n### 3.6 Integration Triggers and User Scenarios\n\nWHEN new product features are enabled or workflows changed, THE system SHALL update the analytics integration for new event types within 48 hours of a business stakeholder request, and document the mapping for audit compliance.\n\n## 4. Notification Channels Integration (Email, SMS, etc.)\n\n### 4.1 Types of Notifications\n\nTHE system SHALL provide notifications for user and business events via email (default), with SMS/other channels as opt-in. Supported events SHALL include:\n- Account registration, verification, password reset\n- Post/comment status changes (approval, block, edit, appeal outcome)\n- Direct messages or replies (if implemented)\n- Votes/reactions received on user content (digest)\n- Platform-wide announcements, policy or compliance updates\n\n### 4.2 Triggering Events and Business Rules\n\nWHEN an event requiring notification occurs (e.g., registration, password reset, post blocked, reaction received), THE system SHALL dispatch a notification immediately for time-sensitive events (account, moderation decisions), or as part of a digest within 30 minutes for less urgent events (votes, reactions).\n\nWHEN a user is subject to discipline (e.g. post blocked, account restricted), THE system SHALL issue a notification citing the rationale, policy reference, and next possible appeal or action.\n\nWHEN a staff role receives a report escalation, THE system SHALL deliver confidential notifications exclusively to moderators/administrators, including appropriate context and summary evidence.\n\n### 4.3 Message Customization and Localization Requirements\n\nTHE system SHALL support fully localized notification content for all supported user languages, defaulting to en-US. Each notification template SHALL be maintainable by administrators, with versioning for policy or legal content updates. All user notifications SHALL reflect user language preference at the time they registered/updated profile.\n\n### 4.4 User Preferences and Opt-out Mechanisms\n\nTHE system SHALL provide members with a full dashboard to opt-in/out of notification types and channels, with each grouping (account, post, moderation, reaction, system announcements) individually configurable, except for legal/mandatory notices. Opt-out for essential alerts SHALL not be permitted.\n\nWHEN a user opts out, THE system SHALL honor that choice for all non-mandatory messages within 24 hours. Notification suppression or unavailability SHALL be logged for audit.\n\n### 4.5 Error Handling and Retry Logic\n\nWHEN notification delivery fails (e.g. bounced email, undelivered SMS), THE system SHALL retry delivery up to 2 times within 10 minutes. IF all attempts fail, THEN THE system SHALL log the failure and (where another channel is available and opted-in) attempt redelivery using alternate channels, also notifying the user of a potential communication issue at their next login.\n\nWHEN administrators observe repeated notification failures, THE system SHALL provide tools to investigate delivery logs, view most common errors, and update notification settings/templates as needed.\n\n### 4.6 Performance Criteria\n\nTHE system SHALL ensure transactional (account/moderation) notifications are delivered within 60 seconds of the triggering event and digest notifications within the interval set by business rules. Audit trails for notification delivery and failure SHALL be accessible to moderators and administrators.\n\n### 4.7 Notification Flow Sequence Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant U as \"User\"\n  participant S as \"System\"\n  participant N as \"Notification Service\"\n\n  U->>S: Perform Action (register, post, comment, etc.)\n  S->>N: Send Notification Event Data\n  N-->>S: Confirm Delivery Status\n  S-->>U: Show Real-Time Feedback (opt-in settings)\n  N-->>U: Deliver Notification via Email/SMS (localized)\n```\n\n## 5. Single Sign-On (Optional)\n\n### 5.1 SSO Needs and Supported Providers\n\nWHERE required for enterprise/academic onboarding, THE system SHALL support SSO using Google, Microsoft, and SAML-compliant providers. SSO enablement, allowed IDPs, and SSO role mapping SHALL be configurable by administrators.\n\n### 5.2 User Journey and Role Mapping\n\nWHEN a new user authenticates via SSO, THE system SHALL create a unique member profile and record the identity provider, role mapping, and origin context.\n\nWHERE SSO is enabled, THE system SHALL apply externally provided group/claim information to correct role assignment per [User Roles and Authentication Documentation](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md). All mapped privileges SHALL be logged and auditable.\n\n### 5.3 Business Logic for Account Linking and Creation\n\nWHEN an existing member links an SSO identity, THE system SHALL:\n- verify user’s email and profile integrity;\n- associate any previous history regardless of sign-on method;\n- preserve reputation, content, and preferences.\n\nDisallowed duplicate linking or identity mismatches SHALL trigger a support workflow and not allow profile creation without administrator review.\n\n### 5.4 Security and Compliance Requirements\n\nTHE system SHALL not store or process external IDP passwords at any point. Only federated, token-based authentication SHALL be used.\n\nSSO integrations SHALL conform with all legal, regulatory, and privacy requirements for enterprise and jurisdiction in which the platform operates; system SHALL routinely export compliance logs for administrator review.\n\nWHEN SSO role/configuration is changed by administrators, THE system SHALL require re-confirmation of all mappings and notify affected users.\n\n### 5.5 Error Scenarios\n\nIF an SSO provider is unreachable, THEN THE system SHALL direct affected users to standard login with a clear message, and capture the failed attempt for audit.\n\nIF required user info (email, role claims) cannot be securely retrieved from the provider, THEN THE system SHALL not create the account and instruct the user to complete registration manually or contact support.\n\nWHEN duplicate or conflicting SSO accounts are detected, THE system SHALL alert the user and staff for resolution, placing access into a \"pending\" or \"locked\" state pending verification.\n\n## 6. General Requirements and Constraints\n\nTHE system SHALL log all critical integration actions and third-party failures for audit by administrators. All integration endpoints SHALL be actively monitored for uptime, performance, and error volume. Administrators SHALL be able to toggle, update, or put integrations into \"safe mode\" to prevent user disruption if an external dependency is degraded or noncompliant.\n\nWHEN a third-party integration fails, and user flow can be safely continued without risk, THE system SHALL provide customized messages to users and gracefully degrade non-core features.\n\nWHEN legal or compliance hazard is detected at an integration point (e.g., privacy violation, terms-of-service issue), THE system SHALL immediately suspend integration, alert support staff, and place related platform actions into a \"manual review only\" mode until resolution.\n\nAll integrations and endpoints SHALL be documented, monitored, and included in administrator activity audits.\n\n## 7.

Every state change is governed by user roles, validation, moderation, and reporting triggers. Content includes posts, comments, votes, and reactions, each with a lifecycle tied to user, moderator, and system events.\n\n### Standard Publishing Workflow\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"User Entry (Post/Comment)\"] --> B{\"Valid by Policy?\"}\n  B -->|\"Yes\"| C[\"Publish: Visible to All\" ]\n  B -->|\"No\"| D[\"Reject: Error Message\" ]\n  C --> E{\"Reported?\"}\n  E -->|\"No\"| F[\"Open for Interaction\" ]\n  E -->|\"Yes\"| G[\"Flagged for Moderation\" ]\n  G --> H{\"Severity > Threshold?\"}\n  H -->|\"Yes\"| I[\"Auto-Hide (Pending Review)\" ]\n  H -->|\"No\"| J[\"Stays Public under Review\" ]\n  I --> K[\"Moderator Review\" ]\n  J --> K\n  K --> L{\"Moderator Action?\"}\n  L -->|\"Edit/Delete\"| M[\"Modify or Remove\" ]\n  L -->|\"Approve\"| N[\"Restore/Stay Public\" ]\n```\n\n### Lifecycle Requirements\n- WHEN a member posts content, THE system SHALL associate authorship and timestamp, enforcing privacy policies per user role.\n- THE system SHALL display new content to all permitted users within 1 second after passing validation.\n- WHILE content is under moderation or appeal, THE system SHALL restrict edits only to moderators/administrators.\n- WHEN content is auto-hidden or deleted by moderation, THE system SHALL log status, notify author, and trigger notification to relevant stakeholders (e.g., moderators, administrators).\n\n### State Table: Content Publishing\n| State         | Entry Trigger                | Role Permissions                     | Exit/Transition Trigger        |\n|---------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Draft         | User creation/edit           | Owner only (member)                  | Submit or discard             |\n| Public        | Passes validation/mod review | All users (subject to view rights)   | Report > threshold/mod action |\n| Flagged       | Sufficient report count      | Moderators, administrators           | Review/decision               |\n| Auto-hidden   | High severity flag           | Moderators, administrators           | Review/decision               |\n| Under Review  | Manual/Auto moderation       | Moderator, administrator             | Approval/removal/appeal       |\n| Deleted       | Moderation/user deletion     | Admin/mod (withdrawn for public)     | Archive/permanent purge       |\n| Archived      | Scheduled/triggered archive  | Administrator (view/audit only)      | Permanent deletion            |\n\n## Moderation and Reporting Flow\n\nMembers and system automations can report content for violations, triggering review processes. Moderators are responsible for handling flagged items, supported by clear business logic for review, edit, deletion, and user escalation. Appeals and audits close the governance loop.\n\n### Moderation/Reporting Workflow Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Reporting\"\n    A[\"Member Reports Content\"]\n    B[\"Report Count or Severity Exceeds Threshold\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Moderation Review\"\n    C[\"Moderator Receives Case\"]\n    D{\"Rule Violation?\"}\n    E[\"Edit/Delete/Restrict Content\"]\n    F[\"Approve/Restore Content\"]\n    G[\"Notify Author/Reporter\"]\n  end\n  subgraph \"Escalation\"\n    H{\"Appeal Submitted?\"}\n    I[\"Assign to Senior Moderator/Admin\"]\n    J{\"Uphold or Reverse Action?\"}\n    K[\"Update Content Status\"]\n    L[\"Final Notify/Log\"]\n  end\n  A --> B --> C\n  C --> D\n  D -->|\"Yes\"| E --> G\n  D -->|\"No\"| F --> G\n  G --> H\n  H -->|\"Yes\"| I --> J\n  J -->|\"Uphold\"| K --> L\n  J -->|\"Reverse\"| K\n  H -->|\"No\"| L\n```\n\n### Requirements for Reports and Moderation\n- WHEN a report is filed, THE system SHALL lock the report to a unique moderator and timestamp initiation.\n- IF report count or automated risk analysis exceeds critical threshold, THEN THE system SHALL immediately auto-hide content and notify moderators within 1 second.\n- WHILE content is under review, THE system SHALL maintain prior status (public/hidden) unless policy demands masking.\n- WHEN a moderator action is taken, THE system SHALL notify both the report originator and the content author with details, rationale, and appeal options within 2 seconds.\n- IF an appeal is submitted within allowed policy window, THEN THE system SHALL escalate to a higher authority (admin/senior moderator) and lock content from further changes during review.\n- THE system SHALL log every moderation action, notification, appeal, and governing rationale for up to 7 years for audit/compliance purposes.\n\n### Edge Cases and Error Handling\n- IF two moderators try to review or act upon the same content, THEN THE system SHALL prevent duplicate actions and assign the case to the first claimant.\n- IF a user attempts to appeal after the allowed window, THEN THE system SHALL reject the appeal and indicate time limit expiry.\n- WHEN content is deleted during an open moderation case, THE system SHALL complete the review process prior to final deletion.\n\n## Archiving and Deletion Policy\n\nContent, user data, and metadata transition from active use to archival and eventual deletion according to business and compliance requirements. Data retention is role- and policy-bound, with recovery, audit, and legal constraints.\n\n### Data Lifecycle Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Content Created\"]\n  B[\"Active (Public/Hidden)\"]\n  C[\"Archived\"]\n  D[\"Scheduled for Deletion\"]\n  E[\"Deleted (Soft Delete)\"]\n  F[\"Permanent Purge\"]\n\n  A --> B\n  B -->|\"Archive Trigger (Inactivity/Schedule)\"| C\n  C -->|\"Mark for Deletion (Policy/User Request)\"| D\n  D -->|\"Deletion/Retention Policy Elapsed\"| E\n  E -->|\"Retention Expires/Audit OK\"| F\n```\n\n### Retention and Recovery\n- WHEN content is deleted by user request, THE system SHALL apply a soft-delete, retaining data for 180 days for potential restoration or audit, masked from public view.\n- WHEN content is subject to regulatory/legal hold, THE system SHALL retain it indefinitely or until explicit release is granted by the responsible administrator.\n- WHEN an audit or inquiry request is initiated during retention, THE system SHALL make all pertinent data available to administrators and compliance officers.\n- WHEN user or system-initiated data archival occurs, THE system SHALL store data in an inaccessible archive, recoverable upon administrator approval.\n- WHEN retention time expires without restoration, THE system SHALL permanently purge the data and erase all recoverable traces.\n\n### User-Initiated Data and Privacy Actions\n- WHEN a member requests erasure of their data, THE system SHALL initiate the deletion process within 24 hours, notify the requesting user, and complete physical removal of all personal data (aside from legal/audit logs) within 7 days.\n- IF a user requests a copy or review of their retained content, THEN THE system SHALL deliver appropriately within legal timeframe (typically 30 days for standard cases).\n- THE system SHALL honor privacy and erasure requests fully, except for data bound to open legal compliance, regulatory investigations, or active appeals.\n\n### Administrator and Moderator Permissions\n- Administrators are empowered to execute permanent deletions, force retention extensions, and release or unarchive data for legal or security purposes. Every action is logged.\n- Moderators may execute soft deletes and initiate archiving according to incident management protocols, but cannot purge or override formal retention policies set at the administrative level.\n\n## Lifecycle State Table\n| State        | Who Can View        | Who Can Edit/Delete    | Typical Retention           | Recovery Path                  |\n|--------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------\n| Active       | All eligible roles  | Owner/mod/admin        | Until flagged or archived   | Edit/delete (by right)         |\n| Hidden       | Mod/admin           | Mod/admin              | Until review/outcome        | Restoration by mod/admin       |\n| Archived     | Admin               | Admin                  | 2 years (default)           | Unarchive by admin             |\n| Deleted (Soft) | Admin/for audit    | Only admin             | 180 days (default)          | Restore by admin if eligible   |\n| Permanently Deleted | None          | None                   | N/A                         | Irrecoverable                  |\n\n## Edge Cases, Errors, and Exceptional Scenarios\n- IF content is requested for deletion but is under appeal/legal review, THEN THE system SHALL flag the deletion and hold action until the appeal or investigation completes.\n- IF an admin attempts to permanently purge content before minimum retention period expires, THEN THE system SHALL block the attempt and notify admin of relevant policy.\n- WHEN a user requests restoration of deleted content before retention expiry, THE system SHALL verify eligibility and, if compliant, restore data within 3 business days.\n- IF archiving triggers fail (e.g., batch archive does not process), THEN THE system SHALL alert the admin within 1 hour and queue content for next available slot.\n- WHEN a user attempts to access archived or deleted content, THE system SHALL deny access and display a retention-status message specifying next steps.\n\n## Cross-Role Data Influence and Permissions\n\n- Guest users are prohibited from altering or initiating any change in data state. All visible content is subject to global content filtering and privacy regulations.\n- Members are limited to their own content modification; voting, reacting, and reporting abilities do not allow viewing or restoring deleted/archived items.\n- Moderators are gatekeepers for content moderation, reporting-based state changes, and soft deletes, operating under explicit business validation rules and audit logging mandates.\n- Administrators hold supreme authority in data lifecycle management, able to execute full deletions, unarchiving, recovery, legal holds, and manual overrides, logged for audit and compliance.\n\n## Performance, Timeliness, and User Experience Requirements\n- WHEN any data state transition occurs, THE system SHALL reflect changes in all user and moderation interfaces within 1 second under normal conditions.\n- WHEN a legally or policy-mandated retention or deletion event is triggered, THE system SHALL process and log it within 24 hours.\n- THE system SHALL process user erasure or privacy requests in under 7 days for all content outside restricted legal/audit holds.\n- WHEN a user requests a data recovery (restore), THE system SHALL evaluate, respond, and, if eligible, process within 3 business days.\n- IF automated or batch data flow routines fail, THEN THE system SHALL queue the event and alert system operators within 15 minutes for remediation.\n\n## Summary\nThe data lifecycle on politicalEconomicBoard progresses through well-defined, policy-driven states impacted by user actions, business validation, moderation, reporting, and regulatory compliance. EARS-based requirements, robust auditing, permission boundaries, and visual diagrams ensure all user roles and administrative stakeholders can clearly navigate, govern, and enforce consistent data flow and lifecycle behaviors.

Introduction\n\nDefining clear, measurable success criteria and a robust monitoring framework ensures that the politicalEconomicBoard platform consistently meets its business objectives while enabling continuous improvement and rapid issue remediation. All requirements are stated to guide backend developers in implementing comprehensive metric collection, role-based segmentation, workflow monitoring, escalation procedures, and ongoing health audits in line with platform needs for engagement, quality, moderation, reliability, and operational excellence. Success is determined by tangible, reportable metrics and their timely review.\n\n## 2. User Engagement Metrics\n\nMeaningful engagement is essential for a thriving discourse community. User engagement must be rigorously measured, segmented by all roles, and reviewed for both volume and quality of participation.\n\n### Quantitative Metrics\n- Total number of posts and comments per day, week, and month per role (guest, member, moderator, administrator)\n- Unique active logins daily, weekly, and monthly per role\n- Number of voting and reaction actions (by role and content type)\n- Thread depth, post longevity, and participation diversity per discussion\n\n### Qualitative Metrics\n- 7-day and 30-day returning user rates, per role\n- New user onboarding-to-first-activity ratio by registration cohort\n- Ratio of guest readers to active contributing members (conversion tracking)\n- Content engagement patterns, e.g., average reactions/votes per post by topic and role\n\n### Role-Based Engagement Tracking\n- Segmentation and comparative analysis of guest, member, moderator, and administrator actions\n- Tracking of moderator and administrator initiations/interventions (e.g., starting official discussions or interventions in threads)\n- Monitoring member achievements, badges, or milestones for activity incentives\n\n### EARS Requirements for Engagement\n- THE system SHALL collect, calculate, and store all engagement metrics listed above for each user role and reporting interval.\n- WHEN a registered member performs any engagement action (post, comment, vote, reaction), THE system SHALL update real-time and aggregate metrics instantly, visible to authorized staff.\n- WHEN a moderator or administrator initiates an engagement action, THE system SHALL log both the action and its type for statistical analysis within 5 minutes.\n- WHEN engagement KPIs drop below 80% of preceding month’s baseline, THE system SHALL notify administrators and initiate a review process within 24 hours.\n- WHEN a data anomaly (e.g., drop-off, surge, missing data) is detected during metric processing, THE system SHALL flag it for administrative review, annotate the affected report, and retain raw data for error correction.\n- WHERE abnormal inactivity is observed for 48 hours consecutively, THE system SHALL trigger a status check and send alert to staff.\n\n### Edge Cases and Business Rules\n- IF user actions cannot be recorded due to system downtime or data store issues, THEN THE system SHALL queue metric data for re-processing within 2 hours of service restoration and annotate dashboard reports with interruption warning.\n- THE system SHALL restrict individual users, regardless of role, from inflating engagement via automated or abusive means, implementing threshold checks and human audit triggers for outlier activity patterns.\n\n### Workflow Example: Engagement Metric Cycle\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"User Performs Action\"] --> B[\"System Updates Real-Time Metric\"]\n  B --> C{\"Is Action by Staff?\"}\n  C -->|\"Yes\"| D[\"Log Staff Engagement by Type\"]\n  C -->|\"No\"| E[\"Record Standard Engagement\"]\n  D --> F[\"Aggregate and Report\"]\n  E --> F\n  F --> G{\"Data Anomaly?\"}\n  G -->|\"Yes\"| H[\"Flag for Admin Review\"]\n  G -->|\"No\"| I[\"Update KPIs/Dashboard\"]\n```\n\n## 3. Content Quality Metrics\n\nContent quality defines the board’s credibility and value. Quality measurement must blend automated and moderator-driven processes, be timely, and enable action on low/high-quality content.\n\n### Core Quality Indicators\n- Ratio of original to duplicate/reposted content submissions\n- Average reaction/vote score per post, subdivided by content category and user role\n- Number of posts assigned high-quality status by moderators or automated process\n- Total reports of factual inaccuracy, violations, or off-topic content per posted item\n- Frequency of manual content reviews, outcome distribution, and rationale capture\n\n### EARS Requirements for Content Quality\n- WHEN any post or comment is submitted or edited, THE system SHALL perform quality assessment via both automated rules and enable moderator review within 1 hour.\n- IF a post or comment accrues more than a platform-defined threshold of negative votes, factual challenge reports, or quality complaints, THEN THE system SHALL flag it for moderator review within 2 hours and notify the author.\n- WHERE content is marked as high quality (either by moderator rating, member consensus, or automated scoring), THE system SHALL reflect this status in both weekly dashboards and user profiles.\n- THE system SHALL log all moderation or audit decisions with rationale for transparency.\n- WHEN a member appeals a quality downgrade or negative content assessment, THE system SHALL initiate a secondary review by another moderator within 48 hours.\n- IF editing or correcting content triggers another quality assessment, THEN THE system SHALL update quality metrics within 30 minutes of the change.\n\n### Workflow Example: Content Quality Monitoring and Escalation\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Content Submitted\"] --> B[\"Automated Quality Scan\"]\n  B --> C{\"Flagged for Review?\"}\n  C -->|\"Yes\"| D[\"Assign Moderator Review\"]\n  D --> E[\"Moderator Renders Decision\"]\n  E --> F[\"Log Rationale, Update Status\"]\n  C -->|\"No\"| G[\"Mark as Normal Quality\"]\n  E --> H{\"Appeal Filed?\"}\n  H -->|\"Yes\"| I[\"Re-review by Alternate Moderator\"]\n  H -->|\"No\"| J[\"Report to KPI Dashboards\"]\n```\n\n### Edge Cases and Quality Validation\n- IF automated scans fail or return inconclusive results, THEN THE system SHALL assign manual review and track scan error rates weekly.\n- IF false-positive rates for quality downgrades exceed agreed threshold (e.g., 3%), THEN THE system SHALL initiate a cross-team review.\n- WHEN duplicate or reposted content is detected, THE system SHALL notify the original poster/author and merge or annotate reposts.\n- THE system SHALL provide authors with structured feedback for any manual quality downgrade.\n\n## 4. Moderation Effectiveness\n\nEffective moderation preserves safety and trust. Monitoring must trace intervention speed, resolution quality, fairness, and appeal outcomes across all roles.\n\n### Moderation Metrics\n- Volume of reported posts/comments per week, segmented by reason and severity\n- Median time from report submission to first moderator response and to final resolution\n- Proportion and distribution of reports resolved at each escalation level (moderator, administrator)\n- Frequency of resolved, escalated, and appealed actions, with typical turnaround times\n- Breakdown of user satisfaction (where feedback is collected) on moderation outcomes per role\n\n### EARS Requirements for Moderation\n- WHEN a user (member, moderator, or admin) submits a report, THE system SHALL immediately notify relevant moderators and log the event for traceability.\n- WHEN a report is opened, THE system SHALL capture timestamps for each review stage (first review, action, closure, appeal initiation, final decision).\n- IF a moderator fails to respond within a 4-hour window, THEN THE system SHALL escalate the report to an administrator and inform affected users.\n- THE system SHALL generate weekly reports summarizing moderation volume, response/turnaround times by case type, and unresolved/overdue cases.\n- WHEN an appeal is filed and not acted upon within 48 hours, THE system SHALL auto-escalate to the next authority level.\n- THE system SHALL track and analyze outcomes where moderation reviewed content is reinstated after appeal, flagging patterns for process improvement.\n\n### Edge Cases and Moderation Rules\n- IF multiple moderators act on the same report simultaneously, THEN THE system SHALL lock the report for the first reviewer and inform others of ongoing action.\n- WHEN a moderation decision is reversed by appeal, THE system SHALL restore content and reputation, notifying all involved parties.\n- IF automated moderation services are unavailable, THEN THE system SHALL route all reports to manual review and annotate dashboard with service disruption alerts.\n\n### Moderation and Appeal Workflow\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Report Submitted\"] --> B[\"Assign Moderator\"]\n  B --> C{\"Response Within 4h?\"}\n  C -->|\"Yes\"| D[\"Review and Decision\"]\n  C -->|\"No\"| E[\"Escalate to Admin\"]\n  D --> F{\"Appeal Filed?\"}\n  F -->|\"Yes\"| G[\"Re-review by New Moderator/Admin\"]\n  F -->|\"No\"| H[\"Log and Report Closure\"]\n  G --> H\n  E --> I{\"Resolved?\"}\n  I -->|\"Yes\"| H\n  I -->|\"No\"| J[\"Notify Stakeholders, Flag Overdue\"]\n```\n\n## 5. Uptime and Reliability\n\nUptime and reliability are non-negotiable for mission-critical civic discourse; requirements must focus on detection, proactive notification, and swift resolution of incidents and degradations.\n\n### Availability Targets\n- Target: >=99.9% service uptime per calendar month\n- Visible, advance communication of all maintenance windows to all user roles\n\n### Monitoring and Logging Requirements\n- THE system SHALL run continuous health checks on all platform services and core dependencies (including third-party integrations) every minute.\n- WHEN a health check fails, THE system SHALL generate a real-time alert to administrators and record the event in a permanent incident log.\n- THE system SHALL log all interruptions, maintenance events, and incident resolutions with detailed root cause, impact, affected users, and time-to-resolution.\n- IF downtime exceeds 15 accumulated minutes in any rolling 30-day period, THEN THE system SHALL trigger a mandatory post-incident reliability review and document required mitigation actions in an internal knowledge base.\n\n### EARS Requirements and Escalation Flows\n- IF service degradation is detected or user complaints about accessibility rise above normal baseline, THEN THE system SHALL trigger immediate escalation and display real-time status banners to all users.\n- WHEN an uptime SLA breach is imminent, THE system SHALL alert administrators and log all steps taken during the recovery process.\n- WHEN repeated failures (2+ incidents/month) occur in core system areas, THE system SHALL assign a task force for in-depth review, requiring a closure summary and future-proofing plan within 7 days.\n\n### Reliability and Incident Response Workflow\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"System Health Check\"] --> B{\"Health Issue Detected?\"}\n  B -->|\"No\"| C[\"Continue Monitoring\"]\n  B -->|\"Yes\"| D[\"Alert Admins & Log Incident\"]\n  D --> E[\"Initiate Recovery/Failover\"]\n  E --> F{\"Within 15m?\"}\n  F -->|\"Yes\"| G[\"Incident Closed, Post-mortem\"]\n  F -->|\"No\"| H[\"Mandatory Mitigation Review\"]\n  G --> I[\"Resume Normal Ops, Publish Report\"]\n  H --> I\n```\n\n### Edge Cases and Special Scenarios\n- IF monitoring services are impaired or offline, THEN THE system SHALL redundantly log diagnostic traces for retroactive analysis and enable manual health-check protocol by administrators.\n- THE system SHALL provide grace periods for maintenance during off-peak hours, as determined by historical activity data per user role.\n\n## 6. Continuous Improvement Processes\n\nSustained service value is driven by regular metric review, feedback integration, and corrective action cycles that address all key user roles and organizational objectives.\n\n### Feedback and Review\n- THE system SHALL accept structured user and staff feedback year-round via web forms, in-app prompts, and direct moderator channels.\n- WHEN feedback is submitted, THE system SHALL log submitter role, context, and feedback type for quarterly aggregation and thematic analysis.\n- THE system SHALL enable direct follow-up or survey requests to select users based on feedback patterns and recent incidents.\n- WHEN thresholds for engagement, quality, or reliability metrics are missed for two consecutive review periods, THE system SHALL require a formal root-cause analysis and documented improvement plan.\n\n### Transparency, Reporting, and Corrective Actions\n- THE system SHALL publish high-level metric dashboards and quarterly summary reports to authorized administrators, with options for community transparency subject to role permissions.\n- WHEN corrective actions are identified, THE system SHALL assign owners, deadlines, and status tracking for each action, requiring closure and verification within agreed timelines.\n- IF corrective actions are overdue or recurring failures are detected, THEN THE system SHALL notify management for escalation.\n- THE system SHALL allow users to subscribe to success metric updates and publish guidance on how feedback is incorporated.\n\n### Continuous Improvement Workflow\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Metric Data and Feedback Collected\"] --> B[\"Quarterly Analysis Meeting\"]\n  B --> C{\"Thresholds Met?\"}\n  C -->|\"Yes\"| D[\"Publish Dashboard/Report\"]\n  C -->|\"No\"| E[\"Initiate Root Cause Review\"]\n  E --> F[\"Define and Assign Actions\"]\n  F --> G[\"Track/Verify Resolution\"]\n  G --> D\n```\n\n### Edge Cases and Exception Paths\n- IF metric review or improvement meetings are skipped for any reason, THEN THE system SHALL escalate to board-level administrators and record reasons for missed cycles.\n- WHEN data reliability is questioned due to anomalies, THE system SHALL initiate independent audit trails.\n\n## 7.
