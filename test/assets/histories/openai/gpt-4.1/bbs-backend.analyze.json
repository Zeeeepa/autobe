Authentication & Authorization Flows\n### 5.1 Login/Token Issuance\n- WHEN a user provides valid credentials, THE API SHALL return an access token.\n- WHEN credentials are invalid, THE API SHALL return an 'Unauthorized' error.\n- WHILE the access token is valid, THE API SHALL allow actions according to the user's role.\n\n### 5.2 Token Validation Middleware\n- THE API SHALL use authentication middleware to validate all requests except those designated as public.\n\n### 5.3 Guest Access\n- IF no valid token is supplied, THEN THE API SHALL treat the user as Guest and restrict actions appropriately.\n\n### 5.4 Role Checks\n- WHEN an endpoint requires elevated permissions, THE API SHALL check the user's role before granting access.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Security & Compliance Considerations\n- THE API SHALL use encrypted (HTTPS) communication for all endpoints.\n- WHEN multi-factor authentication is enabled, THE API SHALL require additional verification during login.\n- IF repeated invalid authentication attempts occur, THEN THE API SHALL implement rate limiting or account lockout measures.\n- THE API SHALL log all access and modification actions made by privileged roles for auditability.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Acceptance Criteria\n- Authentication tokens are strictly required for all non-guest operations.\n- Each role is granted only the minimal necessary privileges for its endpoints.\n- Unauthorized access attempts are logged and rejected with correct error codes.\n- All requirements above are written and testable in EARS format.\n","05_discussion_board_content_moderation_and_policy_handling.md":"# Content Moderation and Policy Handling\n\n## Overview\nThis document defines the comprehensive framework and operational requirements for content moderation, abuse reporting, escalation procedures, and policy enforcement within the Discussion Board system.
