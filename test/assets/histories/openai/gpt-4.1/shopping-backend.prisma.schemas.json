STRATEGIC NOTES: This assignment establishes the backbone of static configuration and categorization for the AIMall platform—critical for cross-domain stability and consistent referencing. These tables hold foundation-level configuration, global platform sections, marketplaces/channels, product category trees, and mappings between sections and categories. No calculated/aggregated fields will be present. Foreign key relationships will be set up, especially between sections, categories, and channels as needed. Platform admin will manage all data here via API or management interface. Indexes for code/name uniqueness and for fast lookup on references will be defined. All tables will conform to 3NF with snapshot or audit capabilities handled elsewhere if required.","draft":"/// @namespace Systematic\nmodel aimall_backend_system_configs {\n  /// Primary Key.\n  id String @id @db.Uuid\n\n  /// Name of this config parameter (unique key).\n  name String\n  /// Value stored for this config parameter (raw text, type interpreted by consuming code).\n  value String\n  /// Description or notes for this config parameter.\n  description String?\n  /// When this config entry was last updated.\n  updated_at DateTime\n\n  @@unique([name])\n  @@index([updated_at])\n}\n\nmodel aimall_backend_platform_sections {\n  /// Primary Key.\n  id String @id @db.Uuid\n\n  /// Human-readable section label (must be unique).\n  label String\n  /// Section code (system unique).\n  code String\n  /// Display order for frontend.\n  display_order Int\n  /// Section is active/visible.\n  active Boolean\n  /// Optional additional notes.\n  description String?\n\n  @@unique([code])\n  @@unique([label])\n  @@index([active])\n}\n\nmodel aimall_backend_market_channels {\n  /// Primary Key.\n  id String @id @db.Uuid\n\n  /// Channel name (displayed to users).\n  name String\n  /// Internal system channel code.\n  code String\n  /// Channel URL or endpoint.\n  url String?\n  /// Channel is currently enabled on platform.\n  enabled Boolean\n  /// Optional admin notes.\n  description String?\n  /// Sort order for listings.\n  display_order Int\n\n  @@unique([code])\n  @@index([enabled])\n}\n\nmodel aimall_backend_product_categories {\n  /// Primary Key.\n  id String @id @db.Uuid\n\n  /// Name of the category.\n  name String\n  /// Category code (unique).\n  code String\n  /// Display order at each tree level.\n  display_order Int\n  /// Parent category reference (null if root).\n  parent_id String? @db.Uuid\n  parent aimall_backend_product_categories? @relation(\"ProductCategoryHierarchy\", fields:[parent_id], references:[id])\n  /// Optional extra info.\n  description String?\n\n  children aimall_backend_product_categories[] @relation(\"ProductCategoryHierarchy\")\n\n  @@unique([code])\n}\n\nmodel aimall_backend_section_category_map {\n  /// Primary Key.\n  id String @id @db.Uuid\n  /// Mapped platform section.\n  platform_section_id String @db.Uuid\n  platform_section aimall_backend_platform_sections @relation(fields:[platform_section_id], references:[id])\n  /// Mapped product category.\n  product_category_id String @db.Uuid\n  product_category aimall_backend_product_categories @relation(fields:[product_category_id], references:[id])\n  /// Display order within section-category combo.\n  display_order Int\n  /// Last updated timestamp.\n  updated_at DateTime\n  /// Optional description.\n  description String?\n\n  @@unique([platform_section_id, product_category_id])\n  @@index([platform_section_id, product_category_id])\n}","review":"Schema code is valid PSL: all tables from assignment present, model names are precisely as required.
