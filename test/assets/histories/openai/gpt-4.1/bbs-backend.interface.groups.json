It covers entities for posts and comments, including the ability to classify posts by category or system configuration, and fully supports hierarchical/nested comment threads as well as author attribution (member/moderator/admin). Primary functional scope includes full CRUD for posts and comments, handling attachments, assigning categories and statuses, supporting replies, and tracking authorship. Relationships are maintained with user entities for authorship, with categories/configuration for classification, and with votes/reports for engagement and moderation purposes. This group is directly responsible for all functional requirements around discussion creation, interaction, moderation-ready content structure, versioning, and soft-deletion workflows."},{"name":"Interactions","description":"This group is dedicated to tracking user engagement with board content, derived from the schema-04-interactions.prisma file. The main entities are discussion_board_post_votes and discussion_board_comment_votes, giving full traceability and analytics on upvotes and downvotes by registered members for posts and comments, respectively. These enable uniqueness constraints (one vote per user per entity), direct relationships to the content and member tables, and auditability through timestamps and soft deletion. The scope of this group includes all CRUD for votes, enforcement of vote uniqueness and directionality (is_upvote boolean), revocation/cancellation of votes, and integration to dashboard or popularity ranking features. Requirements mapping includes post/comment engagement, real-time vote summary, fraud detection, and the calculation of community feedback metrics."},{"name":"Reports","description":"This group handles abuse reporting, sanctions, and disciplinary workflows, as defined in schema-05-reports.prisma, and tables prefixed with discussion_board_post_reports, discussion_board_comment_reports, and discussion_board_user_sanctions.
