[{"name":"Systematic","description":"This group is based on the Systematic namespace and is composed of three foundational tables: pol_eco_board_categories, pol_eco_board_boards, and pol_eco_board_service_settings. pol_eco_board_categories defines the taxonomy and classification for content organization, with hierarchical and navigational features for all other board data. pol_eco_board_boards represents top-level forum boards/sections, strongly linked to one category and incorporating configuration, navigation, and visibility features. pol_eco_board_service_settings is a singleton table managing global platform and feature configurations, such as registration toggling and post/comment limits. Systematic entities have tightly-coupled relations: boards always belong to a category, and various business settings influence core application flows. Endpoints in this group cover all CRUD, search/filtering, and administrative update operations for these core structures, with full tracking of category-board relationships and platform settings enforcement."},{"name":"Actors","description":"This group is derived from the Actors namespace and captures all actor/person entity management tables, specifically pol_eco_board_guests, pol_eco_board_members, pol_eco_board_moderators, pol_eco_board_admins, pol_eco_board_auth_sessions, pol_eco_board_role_transitions, and pol_eco_board_account_audits. pol_eco_board_members and pol_eco_board_guests distinguish authenticated users and visitors, with supporting entities for role elevation (moderator/admin), authentication/session tracking, and audit/compliance records for account-related changes. Actors has intertwined relations among members, sessions, and role status, and includes comprehensive functionality for account lifecycle, authentication, privilege changes, and actor audits. Endpoints allow full exploration of user role hierarchies, session token management, and accountability tracking, all as defined in the Actors Prisma models."},{"name":"Board","description":"This group encompasses board control and management workflows, as defined in schema-03-board.prisma. Key tables are pol_eco_board_board_statuses (tracks board state changes such as locking and archiving), pol_eco_board_board_histories (audits board category assignments and structure changes), and pol_eco_board_moderator_board_assignments (operational mapping of moderators to boards for audits and dashboards). Board entities focus on dynamic changes and permissions to forum boards, distinct from static board definitions (which belong to Systematic). Endpoints here enable detailed tracking and updating of board status/transfers, mapping of moderation coverage, and history of board-level operational actions."},{"name":"Participation","description":"This group is defined by the Participation namespace and covers the entire user-generated content lifecycle: pol_eco_board_posts, pol_eco_board_post_edits, pol_eco_board_comments, pol_eco_board_comment_edits, pol_eco_board_votes, pol_eco_board_tags, pol_eco_board_post_tags, pol_eco_board_reports, and pol_eco_board_attachments. These entities cover posts, comments (and their edits), votes on both objects, tagging and tag attribution, abuse reports (on both posts and comments), and file attachments to posts. Participation models have both parent-child and M:N relationships, e.g., posts to tags, comments to comments (single-level threading), and user-to-vote associations. Business logic around CRUD, complex search/filter, append/edit workflows, vote history, report queueing, attachment lifecycle, and auditability are all managed in this domain."},{"name":"Moderation","description":"This group refers to all moderation and enforcement logic, mapped from the Moderation namespace. It covers tables for pol_eco_board_moderation_actions (actions taken for reported content), pol_eco_board_moderation_audits (full audit trail of those actions), pol_eco_board_sanctions (formal records of sanctions/penalties), pol_eco_board_escalations (escalated cases), and pol_eco_board_appeals (contested moderation outcomes). Moderation group operations encompass reviewing, logging, and managing the status of reports, recording outcomes, issuing sanctions, escalating cases to admins, and supporting appeals and full audit/compliance. All business flows pertaining to enforcement, compliance, and moderation actions are mapped here."},{"name":"Notifications","description":"This group is based on the Notifications namespace and tables, including pol_eco_board_notifications, pol_eco_board_notification_preferences, pol_eco_board_notification_failures, and the relevant provider relationships. These models power the notification system: generating, delivering, tracking, and auditing notification events for all actor roles and channels. Core domains are notification event delivery, notification preference management, notification retry/failure audit, and notification provider tracking (delivery medium, channel support, operational status). Endpoints enable rich notification management, cross-channel delivery troubleshooting, and fine-grained preference control for end users and administrators."},{"name":"Integrations","description":"This group covers all third-party integration tracking and events in the Integrations namespace. Tables handled: pol_eco_board_external_auth_providers (external auth SSO), pol_eco_board_third_party_audit_logs (integration event logs), pol_eco_board_analytics_events (analytics, non-PII), pol_eco_board_anti_spam_events (anti-spam event logs), pol_eco_board_consent_statuses (user/regional consent), and pol_eco_board_notification_providers (notification channel providers). Integrations has a cross-cutting schema function, with each table supporting compliance, business monitoring, provider switching, data privacy, or consent management. Endpoints are provided for CRUD/scripts on all provider/config objects, consent status management, and regulatory-compliant integration/event review."},{"name":"Operations","description":"This group comes from the Operations namespace (schema-08-operations.prisma) and focuses on platform-wide operations, service analytics, incident/maintenance logs, service metrics, audit trails, and business reporting. Main tables: pol_eco_board_operational_logs (system events), pol_eco_board_audit_trails (compliance change history), pol_eco_board_incidents (major incidents/breaches), pol_eco_board_maintenance_windows (downtime/maintenance records), pol_eco_board_service_metrics (aggregated statistics/KPIs), and pol_eco_board_business_reports (scheduled/ad hoc business reports). This group manages supporting operations, real-time status, reporting, compliance/incident lifecycle management, and business reporting endpoints for platform and admin stakeholders."}]
