[{"name":"Systematic","description":"This group is based on the Systematic namespace, as demarcated in the Prisma schema 'schema-01-systematic.prisma'. It comprises the following tables: 'discussion_board_categories', 'discussion_board_settings', 'discussion_board_category_moderators', 'discussion_board_audit_logs', and 'discussion_board_system_notices'. This area handles all core system and administrative infrastructure required by the discussion board: category management and hierarchy, moderator assignment per category, audit log tracking for compliance, configuration options including feature toggles, and the display of global or category-specific system notices. Relationships include parent-child linkage for category hierarchies, many-to-many mapping of moderators to categories, and links from audit logs and system notices back to relevant categories. The key operations for this group encompass full CRUD operations for categories, settings, moderator-category mappings, audit log records, and system notices. Requirements for RBAC, moderation zone assignment, and system-level announcements map directly to these entities."},{"name":"Actors","description":"This group covers the Actors namespace, as found in 'schema-02-actors.prisma' within the Prisma schema. Entities include: 'discussion_board_admins', 'discussion_board_moderators', 'discussion_board_members', 'discussion_board_guests', and 'discussion_board_user_sessions'. The group collectively manages user/visitor identification and role assignments: admin registration and revocation, moderator lifecycle and history, member registration and suspension, guest tracking via session IDs, and the management of persistent user session tokens for all actor types (including login, logout, and authentication). Main relationships include foreign keys linking roles to user identifiers, sessions to actors, and actors to their assigned privileges. Standard operations are included for CRUD on all actor types and for session creation, management, and termination. This fulfills requirements for role-based access, user onboarding, privilege transitions, session validity, and guest-to-member transitions."},{"name":"Articles","description":"The Articles group is founded on the Articles namespace reflected in 'schema-03-articles.prisma', and contains essential content entities for the discussion board: 'discussion_board_topics', 'discussion_board_threads', 'discussion_board_posts', 'discussion_board_post_versions', and 'discussion_board_post_attachments'. These tables are responsible for implementing the core forum structure, enabling hierarchical categorization (topics), sub-discussion organization (threads), member-generated posts, version history for post edits, and file attachments to posts. Table relationships are tightly coupled: topics belong to categories and members, threads belong to topics and members, posts belong to threads and members, and all content has version/attachment audit trails. All standard CRUD operations apply, with additional endpoints for nested resource management (threads under topics, posts under threads, etc.), version rollback/audit, and file management. These directly map to business requirements for threaded discussions, edit tracking, and rich content authoring."},{"name":"Comments","description":"This group includes all comment-related functionality, derived from the Comments namespace defined in 'schema-04-comments.prisma'. It includes: 'discussion_board_comments', 'discussion_board_comment_versions', and 'discussion_board_comment_attachments'. Functionally, it covers: member-authored comments on posts, versioning for comment edit history, and file attachments on comments. Each comment references its post and member, supporting full CRUD, soft delete for moderation, and audit-compliant version change tracking. The group is structurally linked to the Articles and Actors groups through foreign keys. Requirements for discussion participation, auditability, and moderation transparency are fulfilled via these entities."},{"name":"Moderation","description":"The Moderation group encompasses moderation operations, mapped to the Moderation namespace in 'schema-05-moderation.prisma'. Entities included are: 'discussion_board_reports', 'discussion_board_moderation_actions', and 'discussion_board_content_flags'. This domain enables user reporting of inappropriate posts or comments, moderator/admin review and resolution (actions), and the flagging of content for moderation or compliance purposes. Entities have polymorphic relationships to posts and comments, and actions may refer to either a moderator or admin. Standard collection and item CRUD endpoints are required for reports, moderation actions, and active flags, as well as endpoints for resolving, reviewing, and tracking moderation activities. Requirements covered include user reporting, multi-tier moderation workflows, and comprehensive audit logging on all moderator/admin interventions."},{"name":"Notifications","description":"The Notifications group is based on the Notifications namespace seen in 'schema-06-notifications.prisma', consisting of 'discussion_board_subscriptions' and 'discussion_board_notifications'. It handles member subscriptions to topics/threads (for personalized notifications) and persistent notification delivery and tracking (for both in-app and external notifications). Each subscription is tied to a user/member and to either a topic or thread via polymorphic type/ID, and each notification references its recipient, trigger type, and related subscription, if any. Major operations include CRUD for subscriptions and notifications, preference management for notification channels, read/unread status updating, and linkage to articles or discussion activities. All notification, engagement and delivery audit requirements are covered here."},{"name":"Analytics","description":"This group maps to the Analytics namespace reflected in 'schema-07-analytics.prisma' and is focused on operational data tracking and aggregate metrics. Tables are: 'discussion_board_activity_logs' for append-only, immutable audit and engagement logs, and 'discussion_board_engagement_stats' for materialized aggregate analytics at various scopes and time intervals. Relationships connect these logs to the rest of the discussion board entities—members, topics, threads, posts—enabling full traceability. Functional operations include read (and in select cases, write or append) endpoints for activity logs and for viewing statistical aggregates, meeting requirements for admin analytics dashboards, moderation review, and system health compliance."}]
