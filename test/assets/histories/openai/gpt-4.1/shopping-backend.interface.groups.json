[{"name":"Attachment","description":"This group is based on the 'Attachment' schema file and covers all database entities related to the management of uploaded files and attachments in the platform. The primary tables are shopping_mall_ai_attachments, shopping_mall_ai_attachment_versions, and shopping_mall_ai_attachment_business_links. The 'shopping_mall_ai_attachments' table is the master metadata for all uploaded files, including images, documents, invoices, and compliance-related files, with fields for uploader, file name, MIME type, storage URI, size, business domain, retention policy, legal hold status, deleted flag, access control, and timestamps. The 'shopping_mall_ai_attachment_versions' table manages immutable versioning of each attachment, tracking modifications, version number, file URI, file size, timestamps, and notes on the difference/changes per version, along with deletion status. The 'shopping_mall_ai_attachment_business_links' table links attachments to business entities by domain and target ID for traceability, usage, and referential integrity, including the linking user and creation time. Key operations for this group include CRUD on attachments, management of attachment versions (including restore and audit), and business-domain links to associate files to entities such as products, reviews, or invoices. Relationships within this group are strictly hierarchical: an attachment can have multiple versions, and each attachment can be linked to multiple business entities via the links table. Functional requirements covered by this group include file upload, metadata/query/search, retrieval via CDN URIs, compliance/retention enforcement, evidence preservation, access control, and linkage to domain entities. The group supports workflows for upload (with validation), versioning, linkage, retrieval, legal hold management, and explicit soft/hard deletion, mapping directly to the file/business domain asset management needs described in requirements and in the ShoppingMallAi platform's compliance and business processes."}]
