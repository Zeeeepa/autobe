[{"name":"Systematic","description":"This group encompasses all the master data schema from the Systematic namespace, as defined in the corresponding Prisma schema file (e.g., schema-01-systematic.prisma). It includes the following main tables: shopping_mall_ai_sections, shopping_mall_ai_channels, shopping_mall_ai_channel_categories, shopping_mall_ai_channel_category_maps, and shopping_mall_ai_configurations. These entities manage platform-wide section/sub-store configuration, channel setup, hierarchical and channel-specific category definitions/mapping, and global configuration options. Tables are interlinked through foreign keys: for example, shopping_mall_ai_sections and shopping_mall_ai_channels are connected to product/channel mapping and discount logic; shopping_mall_ai_channel_categories and shopping_mall_ai_channel_category_maps tie each channel to its own category structure while also referencing global categories. Key operations supported include CRUD of sections, channels, categories (including listing and nested structures), mapping of categories across contexts, and manipulation of system-wide configuration values. Requirements from the platform’s business documentation (e.g., multi-store, multi-channel, and regionalization support) are implemented directly through these tables and their relationships."},{"name":"Identity","description":"This group comprises all user, seller, and administrator identity management components, which are isolated in the Identity namespace and schema file (schema-02-identity.prisma). It includes: shopping_mall_ai_customers, shopping_mall_ai_sellers, and shopping_mall_ai_administrators. These tables are the foundations for user registration, authentication, OAuth/SSO login, verification status, business credential management, account status, and administrator role mapping. Relationships include one-to-many and one-to-one mappings to other core tables for ownership and actor tracking (such as with shopping_mall_ai_products, shopping_mall_ai_orders, and audit tables). Key functional operations are focused on reading/updating user and seller profiles, role-based account state transitions, and controlling access across all platform modules per requirements. Creation endpoints (e.g., sign-up) will follow system authentication strategy and are usually excluded from core business API. Account deactivation and logical deletion (soft delete) support compliance needs as described in requirements."},{"name":"Catalog","description":"This group centers on all catalog-related schemas, defined in schema-03-catalog.prisma, which include: shopping_mall_ai_products, shopping_mall_ai_product_variants, shopping_mall_ai_product_options, shopping_mall_ai_product_bundles, shopping_mall_ai_product_bundle_items, shopping_mall_ai_product_snapshots, shopping_mall_ai_product_category_maps, shopping_mall_ai_product_channel_maps, and shopping_mall_ai_categories. The group covers full product lifecycle management, option/variant modeling, snapshot/versioned audit trails, bundles, product-to-category/channel mapping, and category tree definition. The schemas are deeply interconnected—products reference sellers, have variants and options, are mapped to both categories and storefronts/channels, and tracked for each significant state change via product snapshots. Key operations include full CRUD on products, options, variants, bundles, mapping management, category definition and relation, and snapshot-based history/rollback. These support business requirements for multichannel catalog, complex product configurations, and lifecycle/audit compliance."},{"name":"Carts","description":"This group is based on the Carts namespace (schema-04-carts.prisma) and is responsible for cart session management in both authenticated and guest scenarios. It includes shopping_mall_ai_carts, shopping_mall_ai_cart_items, and shopping_mall_ai_cart_merge_logs. These tables collectively manage shopping cart lifecycle, guest-to-user migration, cross-device persistence, per-item selection, and audit logging for merges. Carts can reference customers (when logged in), and associate many items each to products/variants; merge logs track transitions between carts during identity transition or device restoration. Operations include cart creation, update, item add/remove, session expiration, and event/audit log review for customer support and compliance, per requirements."},{"name":"Orders","description":"This group covers all schema entities governing order management, fulfillment, payment, state transition/audit, and post-purchase flows, organized under Orders and defined in schema-05-orders.prisma. Main tables: shopping_mall_ai_orders, shopping_mall_ai_order_items, shopping_mall_ai_order_suborders, shopping_mall_ai_order_state_logs, shopping_mall_ai_payments, shopping_mall_ai_refunds, shopping_mall_ai_returns, and shopping_mall_ai_after_service_requests. The schemas enable multi-role workflows (customer, seller, admin), support entire order lifecycle (with suborders for split fulfillment), link payments/refunds/returns directly to orders, and provide a detailed state audit log. Operations handled here include creating orders, managing and tracking fulfillment, handling and logging payments/refunds/returns after-service/complaints, and supporting cascading state transitions and compliance audit trails. The requirements map directly to complex, multi-seller order flows and legal/financial compliance as defined in the documentation."},{"name":"Discounts","description":"This group manages the Discounts domain, defined in schema-06-discounts.prisma. Main tables: shopping_mall_ai_coupons, shopping_mall_ai_coupon_issuance_logs, shopping_mall_ai_coupon_redemption_logs, shopping_mall_ai_discount_campaigns, shopping_mall_ai_discount_rules. These schemas drive all coupon, discount, and campaign-related logic, including coupon creation/issuance, enforcement of business rules/eligibility/quota, redemption tracking, campaign setup, stackability, and audit compliance. Coupons reference their source campaigns as well as issuers (seller or admin), are linked to issuance/redemption logs, and applied via mapping rules at product, category, or channel scope. Operations include issuing, redeeming, suspending, and auditing coupons and campaigns, and enforcing eligibility/stacking logic as outlined in functional requirements."},{"name":"Finance","description":"This group encompasses all customer balance management, account-based ledger, and audit logging defined in schema-07-finance.prisma. Main tables: shopping_mall_ai_deposit_accounts, shopping_mall_ai_mileage_accounts, shopping_mall_ai_deposit_transactions, shopping_mall_ai_mileage_transactions, shopping_mall_ai_financial_audit_logs. They collectively manage user deposit and mileage accounts, ledger activity for each, credits/debits from core flows (such as orders, refunds, incentives), and log all account-impacting actions for audit. Each account is owned by a customer, transactions reference the origin (order, payment, refund, coupon), and every update/event is tracked as an immutable audit log. Operations in this group include account balance updates, earning/redeeming deposit/mileage, transaction history viewing, and investigating financial audit trails per business/legal requirements."},{"name":"Community","description":"This group organizes the Community features as defined in schema-08-community.prisma: shopping_mall_ai_reviews, shopping_mall_ai_review_snapshots, shopping_mall_ai_inquiries, shopping_mall_ai_inquiry_snapshots, shopping_mall_ai_comments, shopping_mall_ai_comment_snapshots, and shopping_mall_ai_moderation_logs. These tables support full review/inquiry systems, threaded comments/replies, edit/delete snapshot history, and moderation/audit for legal/compliance. All community interactions are tied to products/orders/users, with strong support for evidence, workflow states (by business role), and event-based history for dispute/legal defense. The group’s operations cover CRUD for reviews/inquiries/comments, edit history, moderation actions, and evidence/audit retrieval, responding directly to business requirements for transparency, trust, and workflow compliance."},{"name":"Attachment","description":"This group is dedicated to attachment and file management, as defined in schema-09-attachment.prisma. It includes: shopping_mall_ai_attachments, shopping_mall_ai_attachment_versions, shopping_mall_ai_attachment_business_links. These tables serve all business domains for file upload, versioning, business-domain linkage, and audit/retention policy enforcement. shopping_mall_ai_attachments tracks files at rest, ownership, legal/retention status, and ACLs; shopping_mall_ai_attachment_versions logs all file history for chain-of-custody and compliance; shopping_mall_ai_attachment_business_links maps files to business objects (e.g., product, review, evidence) for context-aware retrieval. All file-oriented workflows—upload, replace/version, business-object linking, legal hold, evidence management—are handled by this group as described in the requirements and are required for legal defensibility and comprehensive business traceability."},{"name":"AIBusinessLogic","description":"This group includes all tables dedicated to AI-driven and analytics logic, from recommendation engines to individualized profiles, personalization tracking, exposures for analytics, AI-powered price optimization, fraud log tracking, incident logging, and global audit. Defined in schema-10-ai_businesslogic.prisma, entities include: shopping_mall_ai_ai_reco_signals, shopping_mall_ai_ai_personalization_profiles, shopping_mall_ai_ai_analytics_exposures, shopping_mall_ai_ai_price_optimizations, shopping_mall_ai_fraud_logs, shopping_mall_ai_incident_logs, shopping_mall_ai_audit_trails.
