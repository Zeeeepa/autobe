[{"name":"Actors","description":"This group corresponds to the 'Actors' namespace as explicitly defined in the Prisma schema (schema-01-actors.prisma) for the todoList application. The principal database entity in this group is the 'todolist_users' table, which handles all user accounts, authentication, and identity lifecycle functionality. Its schema defines unique email-based user identification, credential storage, email verification, last login time, password reset tokens, and deletion status fields. The group's functional scope is limited to operations involving user registration, authentication status verification, email verification tracking, and password/credential management. The 'todolist_users' table is foundational for enforcing business policies of account privacy, soft deletion, session and password recovery flows, and audit trails. It maintains relationships to tasks via a one-to-many (1:N) connection with 'todolist_tasks' and implements business logic crucial to personal data protection, account lifecycle management, and privacy compliance. All system membership and login-related behaviors originate from this group, as specified by references in business and requirements documentation."},{"name":"Tasks","description":"This group is mapped directly to the 'Tasks' namespace, found in schema-02-tasks.prisma of the Prisma schema files. This group manages the primary business entity 'todolist_tasks', which represents all individual todo items for a registered user. The 'todolist_tasks' table links to the owning user via the 'todolist_user_id' foreign key (to 'todolist_users.id'), ensuring strict per-user data segregation. This group's scope includes all functional operations for todo items: creation, retrieval (listing, filtering, and detail fetch), updating (editing, status transitions), soft deletion (via the 'deleted_at' timestamp), restoration, batch actions, completion status updates, and support for the business state model ('active', 'completed', 'deleted'). Data and functional integrity are provided by indexes for search/trgm, state, and timestamps, and by enforcing soft-deletion and retention policies. The Tasks group is responsible for full CRUD lifecycle management, status transition enforcement, and restoration/irreversible deletion logic, and for ensuring task management operates solely within the authenticated user's domain per business requirements."}]
