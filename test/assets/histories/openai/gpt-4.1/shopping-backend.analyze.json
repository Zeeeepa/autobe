This navigational guide ensures every reader can trace user needs, platform processes, compliance mandates, and integration points throughout the entire documentation set, supporting both strategic decision-making and immediate development execution.\n\n---\n\n## Service Vision & Business Model\nUnderstanding why the platform exists, who the target markets are, and what core problems the shoppingMallAi platform solves is foundational. The [Service Vision and Business Model](./01-service-vision-and-business-model.md) covers the market need, business justification, competitive differentiation via AI/ML, monetization strategies, growth plans, and metrics that define business success.\n\n## User Roles & Authentication\nA robust permissions model is essential for security and business process separation. The [User Roles and Authentication Guide](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md) details each platform role (customer, seller, administrator), how users are authenticated (including OAuth and SSO), JWT/token strategies, session management, a complete permissions matrix, and policies for identity management and compliance.\n\n## Core Functional Requirements\nThe [Core Functional Requirements Specification](./03-core-functional-requirements.md) defines all user-driven business processes, from onboarding and registration to product discovery, transactional workflows, and user feedback. This section outlines what every system user must be able to do, including comprehensive EARS-format requirements for registration, catalog, checkout, orders, reviews, and more.\n\n## Product & Catalog Management\n[Product and Catalog Management Requirements](./04-product-and-catalog-management.md) lay out the policies and business logic for product onboarding, editing, category and section structuring, bundling and variant handling, inventory management, and full lifecycle versioning/snapshots, ensuring compliance and flexibility for multi-channel sales operations.\n\n## Order & Cart Management\nAll order lifecycle rules, from cart session validity to post-purchase after-service, are included in the [Order and Cart Management Requirements](./05-order-and-cart-management.md). This section spans validation logic, payment and split fulfillment flows, order creation/modification/cancellation, and real-time notifications required for seamless operations and customer satisfaction.\n\n## Discounts, Payments & Financial Flows\nCritical business domains governing coupon eligibility, issuance, redemptions, discounts, deposit/mileage grants, payment validations, and fraud controls are addressed in the [Discounts, Payments, and Financial Flows Specification](./06-discounts-payments-and-financial-flows.md). Rules and workflow diagrams clarify financial decision points for all user roles.\n\n## Customer Interaction & Community Features\nCustomer engagement, feedback, reviews, Q&A, moderation policies, content history tracking, and evidence preservation requirements are specified in [Customer Interaction and Community Features](./07-customer-interaction-and-community-features.md). This area covers workflows for both user interaction and business rule enforcement in reputation management.\n\n## Personalization & AI Intelligence\nAI-driven recommendations, contextual search, personalization rules, fraud detection logic, price optimization, and analytics features are thoroughly described in the [Personalization and AI Intelligence Requirements](./08-personalization-and-ai-intelligence.md). Use case summaries and flow diagrams highlight how artificial intelligence shapes the business and customer journeys.\n\n## Infrastructure & Scalability\nWhile specific technical architecture is out of scope, requirements affecting scalability and modularity—such as data snapshotting, audit processes, and horizontal expansion capabilities—are addressed where relevant within each functional requirement document, guiding future infrastructure decisions.\n\n## Security & Compliance\nSecurity and business compliance rules are comprised of authentication, user permission enforcement, policy auditing, evidence retention, and incident tracking. These policies are primarily documented in the [User Roles and Authentication Guide](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md), with further compliance rules referenced in operational and domain logic requirements.\n\n## Performance, Error Handling & Usability\nPerformance SLAs, error recovery, usability standards, and exception reporting processes—all documented in the [Performance, Error Handling, and Usability Specification](./11-performance-error-handling-and-usability.md)—detail how the platform must behave for all users in both normal and exceptional cases.\n\n## Integration & Extensibility\nRequirements for connecting with external services, integrating payment providers, supporting modular plug-ins, API management, backwards compatibility, and extensibility for future business scenarios are detailed in [Integration and Extensibility Requirements](./12-integration-and-extensibility.md).\n\n## Business Rules & Domain Logic\nSystem-wide enforceable rules, validation procedures, lifecycle policies (e.g., coupon stackability, order/inventory edge cases, refund/cancellation constraints), and audit mechanisms are comprehensively detailed in [Business Rules and Domain Logic](./10-business-rules-and-domain-logic.md).

Buyers encounter overwhelming choice, limited relevance, non-customized shopping experiences, delays in finding desired products, and lack of assurance in service quality or support. Sellers, meanwhile, face substantial hurdles managing inventory, reaching the right audiences, adapting pricing in real time, and competing in saturated, scale-driven markets where differentiation by intelligence—not just by size—has become essential.\n\nDespite explosive growth, most major platforms still operate with basic keyword search, static listings, and non-adaptive service flows that do not leverage contextual or behavioral data. There is a clear market gap for an integrated, AI-powered commerce ecosystem that proactively and intelligently matches buyers to the right products, helps sellers anticipate and respond to demand shifts instantly, and automates end-to-end support and community engagement.\n\n## Business Justification (Why)\n\nRising customer and seller expectations demand a shift from traditional, rule-based e-commerce to intelligence-first marketplaces. Modern consumers expect instant, hyper-relevant product discovery, transparent support, and proactive service. Sellers look for autonomy in merchandising, predictive analytics to drive growth, and fair access to platform benefits.\n\nWHEN a user searches for any product or service,\nTHE system SHALL dynamically analyze their preferences, search intent, purchase history, and contextual data to deliver highly relevant matches within 2 seconds.\n\nWHERE sellers engage with the platform,\nTHE system SHALL provide actionable insights, AI-driven predictions on inventory and pricing, and automated tools for campaign management and performance benchmarking.\n\nIF shoppers or sellers encounter friction (slow navigation, irrelevant offers, difficulty comparing products),\nTHEN THE system SHALL identify the chokepoint via behavioral analytics and surface recommendations to optimize flow and satisfaction.\n\nThis business exists because modern e-commerce success hinges on responsiveness, relevance, transparency, and efficiency—outcomes best achieved through embedded AI.\n\n## Core Value Proposition\n\nshoppingMallAi provides a unique, scalable, multi-role shopping mall environment that leverages AI at every level of the customer, seller, and administrator journey. Business value for each role includes:\n\n- For buyers: Hyper-personalized discovery and curation, tailored deals, rapid checkouts, and automated support.\n- For sellers: Predictive inventory management, real-time analytics on demand trends, dynamic pricing support, and campaign automation.\n- For administrators: Rule-based and AI-augmented moderation, automated fraud detection, actionable business diagnostics, and system-wide operational intelligence.\n\nWHEN a customer enters the mall,\nTHE system SHALL personalize all product feeds, offers, and navigation for that session based on their prior activity, stated preferences, and detected intent, updating recommendations in real time as they interact.\n\nWHEN a seller initiates a campaign or manages stock,\nTHE system SHALL provide dashboards that display current sales performance, highlight high-potential products, and recommend optimal promotional actions using live data.\n\nWHEN an administrator reviews platform performance,\nTHE system SHALL flag emerging patterns or risks (e.g., fraud, drops in engagement) and suggest automated or manual interventions to sustain marketplace health.\n\n## AI Technology Differentiators\n\nshoppingMallAi is designed from the ground up as an AI-first commerce platform, integrating machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics across all core workflows.\n\nDistinctive AI capability areas include:\n- Real-time, personalized product recommendations for every buyer based on explicit and implicit signals\n- Natural language, semantic search and product tagging for smarter queries and higher match relevance\n- Fully automated customer service using AI chat, context-driven FAQ, and instant issue triage\n- AI-powered demand and inventory forecasting for sellers, with prescriptive alerts for restocking and trend anticipation\n- Algorithmic pricing support that adjusts to market, supply, and demand signals with seller-configurable boundaries\n- Transaction risk and fraud analysis that continuously scans actions, payment behaviors, and reviews\n- Automated review summarization to surface highest-quality content and enhance trust\n\nWHERE AI augments traditional operations,\nTHE system SHALL minimize manual intervention, decrease operational cost, and maximize relevance, conversion, and user satisfaction across roles.\n\n### Concrete Scenarios\n\nWHEN a new user registers with little purchase history,\nTHE system SHALL use cohort analysis and behavioral signals to immediately recommend the most likely relevant products and offers, reducing onboarding friction.\n\nWHEN emerging market or event-driven trends are detected,\nTHE system SHALL alert sellers to adjust inventory or launch campaigns ahead of the competition.\n\n## Revenue Model\n\nshoppingMallAi’s revenue streams are diversified through AI-enhanced mechanics:\n- Commission Fees: Transaction-based commissions on completed purchases (with rate differentiation for AI-enabled vs. standard transactions)\n- Subscription Tiers: Monetized access for sellers to advanced AI analytics, campaign automation, premium placement, and exposure\n- Sponsored and Dynamic Placements: Auction- or algorithm-based priority for AI-identified high-potential products\n- Personalized Promotions: Sellers pay for participation in targeted, AI-optimized discount events or cross-sell campaigns\n- Value-Added Services: Revenue from logistics support, automated customer care, and personalized marketing solutions (as bundled or pay-per-use)\n\nWHEN a seller upgrades to a premium analytics tier,\nTHE system SHALL unlock AI-driven dashboards, optimization recommendations, and priority visibility in category-specific feeds.\n\nWHEN a buyer consents to personalized promotions,\nTHE system SHALL apply predictive offers and real-time discounts, increasing conversion and average order value.\n\nIF a revenue anomaly or fraudulent trend is detected,\nTHEN THE system SHALL suspend related transactions, notify stakeholders, and trigger AI-based audit and review.\n\n## Growth and Retention Plan\n\n### Growth Strategy\n- Early and incentive-driven onboarding for buyers and sellers, leveraging AI-powered onboarding journeys and referral campaigns\n- Viral loops through shareable wishlists, AI-personalized collections, and user-driven social features\n- Content and product diversity fueled by AI-driven seller tools for catalog enrichment\n- Market-specific scaling through adaptive localization and AI-translated messaging\n\n### Retention and Engagement\n- Ongoing reinforcement of loyalty via personalized rewards, achievement badges, and predictive re-engagement triggers\n- Seller retention through actionable analytics, AI-moderated feedback, and fair, transparent exposure algorithms\n- Administrator control panels for governance, predictive platform health analytics, and automated issue escalation\n\nWHEN buyer or seller retention metrics decline in a segment,\nTHE system SHALL trigger automatic cohort analysis and produce recommended interventions, such as targeted rewards or engagement campaigns.\n\nWHEN platform usage spikes due to seasonal trends or marketing,\nTHE infrastructure and workflows SHALL elastically scale, maintaining UX performance and operational insight for all roles.\n\n## Key Success Metrics\n\nSuccess for shoppingMallAi is measured with direct linkage to business and AI impact:\n\n- User Engagement:\n  - Growth in Monthly/Active Daily Users, repeat visit and session depth, and positive action conversion (e.g., wishlist creation, product sharing)\n- Conversion and Retention:\n  - Decrease in cart abandonment rate, uplift in purchase completion, and improved repeat-buyer ratios\n- AI Impact:\n  - Proportion of sales and engagement traceable to AI-driven recommendations or pricing\n  - Uptake and satisfaction with seller-side AI dashboards and interventions\n  - Reduction in manual moderation, fraud events, or support tickets\n- Revenue and Marketplace Health:\n  - Growth in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), commission, Average Revenue per User (ARPU)\n  - Seller acquisition, activity, and churn rates, tied to AI-powered feature adoption\n- Operational Resilience:\n  - Infrastructure uptime and transaction success rates, especially during AI-driven promotional events\n\nWHEN system performance is monitored,\nTHE analytics SHALL attribute trends to particular AI/ML-enabled workflows, enabling actionable feedback and continual optimization.\n\nWHEN new buyer or seller cohorts are onboarded,\nTHE business analytics SHALL segment retention and KPIs by acquisition source, engagement actions, and AI-feature usage to fine-tune both onboarding and lifecycle marketing.\n\n---\n\nFor a full breakdown of user roles and access levels, see the [User Roles & Authentication Specification](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md).

User Registration & Profile Management\n### 1.1 Customer and Seller Onboarding\n- WHEN a guest accesses shoppingMallAi, THE system SHALL allow unrestricted product browsing, filtering, and category navigation without mandatory login or registration, except for actions requiring authentication.\n- WHEN a guest elects to register, THE system SHALL present email+password and OAuth-based registration options, capturing explicit Terms of Service and privacy policy consent, and verifying unique email and optionally mobile number.\n- WHEN a customer completes registration, THE system SHALL trigger verification workflows (email, optionally SMS) and block order placement or review functionality until successful verification.\n- WHEN a seller applies for account registration, THE system SHALL require all regulatory business registration data, license/certification uploads, bank and tax information, a display name, and emergency contacts, enforcing data validation on each field.\n- WHEN an administrator reviews seller applications, THE system SHALL provide controls to approve, suspend, or reject, recording detailed reasoning for audit, and automatically notify the applicant of decision and rationale.\n- IF registration data is invalid, incomplete, or fails compliance checks, THEN THE system SHALL block progression, itemize fields in error with actionable reasons, and provide guidance for corrective action.\n\n### 1.2 Profile Management\n- THE system SHALL provide authenticated users (customer, seller, administrator) with secure, role-based interfaces to manage profile data, update contact information, change passwords, and configure notification preferences, barring modification of non-editable regulatory fields.\n- WHEN a user requests password reset, THE system SHALL require multi-factor identification (email or phone verification) and apply a time-limited, single-use reset token.\n- WHEN profile update attempts violate input or business rule constraints (e.g. invalid phone, duplicate email, forbidden field, illegal business doc), THEN THE system SHALL reject the update, highlight the specific error(s), and log for audit.\n- WHERE a user has no account activity (login or transaction) for 12 consecutive months, THE system SHALL flag the account for periodic data revalidation and present a re-verification prompt on next login.\n\n## 2. Product Search & Browsing\n### 2.1 Browsing Experience\n- THE system SHALL organize products in hierarchical, multi-level categories and sections to facilitate intuitive browsing and advanced filtering on attributes such as price, brand, seller, review rating, and availability.\n- WHEN a user (guest or authenticated) enters a category, keyword, or applies filters, THE system SHALL retrieve and present up to 1,000 matching products within 2 seconds, sorted by user-configurable criteria with responsiveness tracked for audit compliance.\n- IF the search query yields no results, THEN THE system SHALL provide zero-results feedback, suggested search refinements, and display trending products or bestsellers as alternatives, logging the query for analytics.\n- IF the query is invalid (e.g. nonsensical, banned, or too broad), THEN THE system SHALL prompt for refinement and offer context-specific suggestions.\n\n### 2.2 Product Details\n- WHEN a customer or guest selects a specific product, THE system SHALL display all available business properties, including images, price (and historical price if changed), active options, stock levels, expected shipping information, seller information, and aggregated customer review scores.\n- WHERE the product is out of stock, THE system SHALL disable cart and checkout functions, display \"out-of-stock\" status, and offer recommendations for comparable alternatives in the same category.\n- WHEN product details (e.g., price, inventory, options) are changed by the seller or administrator, THE system SHALL create and archive immutable history snapshots for business audit, legal compliance, and restoration purposes, including timestamp and actor.\n- WHEN a restricted or regulated product is accessed, THE system SHALL require appropriate user verification (age, region) and block ineligible users from purchase or order actions.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Shopping Journey Flow\"\n    A[\"Guest Browses\"] --> B[\"Registers or Logs In\"]\n    B --> C[\"User(Customer/Seller)Profile Created\"]\n    C --> D[\"Searches Product\"]\n    D --> E[\"Filters/Sorts/Searches\"]\n    E --> F[\"Views Product Detail\"]\n    F --> G{\"Stock Available?\"}\n    G -->|\"Yes\"| H[\"Add to Cart\"]\n    G -->|\"No\"| I[\"Show Alternatives\"]\n  end\n```\n\n## 3. Checkout & Purchase Flows\n### 3.1 Cart & Order Preparation\n- WHEN a customer adds a product to cart, THE system SHALL instantly validate and sync price, inventory, stock status, and enforce business eligibility (per-user or per-SKU limits, option selection, combination rules).\n- THE system SHALL provide real-time calculation of order totals, including taxes, shipping, and dynamic application of active discounts, coupons, and mileage, showing changes as cart is updated.\n- IF a cart item becomes invalid due to price change, unavailability, or eligibility loss, THEN THE system SHALL flag the item with a warning, provide detailed remediation steps, and disable checkout for the item until resolution.\n\n### 3.2 Checkout Process\n- WHEN a user confirms readiness to check out, THE system SHALL collect and validate recipient address, contact number, payment method selection, delivery option, and any optional buyer messages, enforcing real-time formatting and business validation on each required field.\n- WHERE available, THE system SHALL present customers with all payment options legal and permitted for their geography and order value (credit/debit card, bank transfer, mobile pay, deposit/mileage offset, etc.), enforcing per-channel business restrictions and compliance with payment policy.\n- WHEN user submits checkout information, THE system SHALL authenticate payment/token authorization with external providers, validate eligibility of applied coupons or mileage (validity period, stacking configuration, usage quota), and proceed only on full validation success.\n- IF payment initiation fails, THEN THE system SHALL display a specific reason (code/message), log the transaction attempt, support safe retry or alternate payment selection, and provide recommended next steps and support contact if not resolved.\n\n### 3.3 Order Creation\n- WHEN payment is successfully confirmed, THE system SHALL create an immutable order record with full customer, seller, item, timestamp, financial and delivery breakdown, and assign a globally unique order identifier.\n- WHERE the order includes products from multiple sellers, THE system SHALL automatically split fulfillment into distinct sub-orders, map suborder ownership to corresponding sellers, notify all affected parties, and transparently display split order structure to the customer.\n- WHEN order creation is finalized, THE system SHALL issue real-time notifications to the customer (SMS/email/push where permitted), update seller dashboards with new order events, and increment analytics for operational monitoring.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Checkout & Payment Flow\"\n    A[\"Cart Prepared\"] --> B[\"Initiate Checkout\"]\n    B --> C[\"Input Address/Payment\"]\n    C --> D{\"Validation Success?\"}\n    D -->|\"Yes\"| E[\"Process Payment\"]\n    D -->|\"No\"| F[\"Show Error/Retry\"]\n    E --> G{\"Multi-Seller?\"}\n    G -->|\"Yes\"| H[\"Split Order\"]\n    G -->|\"No\"| I[\"Single Order\"]\n    H --> J[\"Notify Each Seller\"]\n    I --> J\n    J --> K[\"Order Confirmation to Customer\"]\n  end\n```\n\n## 4. Order Status Tracking\n### 4.1 Order State Management\n- THE system SHALL represent each order through the lifecycle states: 'pending', 'paid', 'fulfillment in progress', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'completed', 'canceled', with clear vocabulary and visual indicators for all actors.\n- WHEN order state transitions, THE system SHALL record a timestamped and actor-annotated snapshot event for audit and compliance, and immediately notify affected parties (customer, seller, admin) via their preferred communication method.\n- WHERE fulfillment is subdivided into sub-orders or individual items, THE system SHALL maintain status synchronization between parent order and all subcomponents, propagate change notifications, and escalate delays or exceptions in any sub-order.\n- WHEN customer, seller, or administrator queries order status, THE system SHALL present the current state, a full event history with timestamps and actors, projected fulfillment timelines, and all possible next actions (including cancellation, return, escalation, or inquiry).\n- IF an order or sub-order is canceled (by customer before payment, by seller or admin in allowed cases), THEN THE system SHALL immediately document the initiator, time, business reason, supporting evidence (for seller/admin), and process full financial reversal or refund in compliance with payment policy.\n- IF order state transitions are prevented or delayed due to unresolved dependencies (e.g., pending payments, review investigations, after-service requests), THEN THE system SHALL display the dependency explanation, block further workflow, and support escalation as needed.\n\n## 5. Review & Inquiry Management\n### 5.1 Product Reviews\n- WHEN a customer receives all items in an order, THE system SHALL open a 30-day review submission window per product, and restrict review eligibility to customers who have completed payment for that item.\n- THE system SHALL enforce a strict one-review-per-customer-per-product-per-order rule, preventing duplicates, but allowing edits during the open period (edits are snapshot versioned for integrity and compliance).\n- WHEN a review is submitted or subsequently edited, THE system SHALL create and store a full snapshot of all prior versions, exposing the current version and recording edit history for audit and potential legal/statistical inquiry.\n- IF a review is reported as abusive, fraudulent, or violating policy, THEN THE system SHALL flag it for administrator moderation, record escalation events and outcomes, and restrict public visibility during the investigation workflow.\n\n### 5.2 Customer/Seller Inquiries\n- WHEN a customer submits an inquiry or issue ticket (product, order, platform), THE system SHALL categorically route the ticket to the appropriate seller or administrator response queue, based on the business domain and product/channel mapping.\n- THE system SHALL require sellers to acknowledge and respond to open inquiries within 3 business days, and automatically generate reminders to both seller and platform administrator in case of overdue tickets.\n- IF a seller fails to respond for more than the permitted interval, THEN THE system SHALL escalate unresolved inquiries to an administrator, log the breach, and support buyer compensation flow or penalty per business rule.\n- WHERE an inquiry is resolved, THE system SHALL close the ticket, retain its full record and evidence chain per business/legal retention policy, and notify all involved parties of resolution outcome with status commentary.\n- IF a customer or seller attempts to post an inquiry with insufficient information or attached evidence, THEN THE system SHALL block submission, highlight missing requirements, and guide for correction prior to ticket acceptance.\n\n\n## 6. Role-based Feature Access\n### 6.1 Permissions by Role\n- THE system SHALL restrict all feature and workflow access in strict accordance with user role (customer, seller, administrator), enforcing access policies throughout the application, visible in audit/reporting interfaces.\n- WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to invoke member-only business actions (e.g., add to cart, order placement, review submission), THE system SHALL deny access, present a clear authentication prompt, and, if possible, preserve workflow state for resumption post-login.\n- WHERE a seller attempts transactions or management operations against resources not owned or administered by them (foreign products, orders, analytics), THE system SHALL block the operation, log the unauthorized attempt with all contextual metadata, and optionally flag for administrator review in case of abuse patterns.\n- WHEN an administrator executes any modification affecting customer/seller business data or service workflows, THE system SHALL capture before-and-after snapshots of the data, bind them to the acting admin's identity, and retain records in a tamper-evident audit store for compliance and dispute resolution.\n- WHEN access is attempted during account suspension, tenure-based restriction, or compliance holds, THE system SHALL present the business rationale and required remediation steps to the user before allowing further action.\n- THE system SHALL ensure that feature and API access is always harmonized with the real-time permissions matrix for all roles.\n\n| Feature                              | Customer | Seller | Administrator |\n|--------------------------------------|:--------:|:------:|:-------------:|\n| Register & Update Profile            |    ✅     |   ✅   |      ✅        |\n| Browse/Search Products               |    ✅     |   ✅   |      ✅        |\n| Create Cart & Checkout               |    ✅     |   ❌   |      ❌        |\n| Manage Product Listings              |    ❌     |   ✅   |      ✅        |\n| View Order Status                    |    ✅     |   ✅   |      ✅        |\n| Manage/Refund Orders                 |    ❌     |   ✅   |      ✅        |\n| Post Reviews/Inquiries               |    ✅     |   ✅   |      ✅        |\n| Moderate Content/Users               |    ❌     |   ❌   |      ✅        |\n| Access Analytics/Dashboards          |    ❌     |   ✅   |      ✅        |\n| View Financial/Business Analytics    |    ❌     |   ✅   |      ✅        |\n| Issue Coupons/Discounts              |    ❌     |   ✅   |      ✅        |\n| Validate Seller Credentials          |    ❌     |   ❌   |      ✅        |\n| Approve/Suspend Buyers/Sellers       |    ❌     |   ❌   |      ✅        |\n| Access Platform Configuration        |    ❌     |   ❌   |      ✅        |\n\n## 7. Error Handling & Performance Requirements\n### 7.1 Error Scenarios\n- IF required user input is missing, malformed, or does not meet business rule at any step (registration, checkout, review, inquiry), THEN THE system SHALL respond with a field-specific, actionable error message, localize to user language, and guide the user in correction steps before permitting workflow continuation.\n- IF an external provider or subsystem (payment, logistics, email/SMS, authentication) fails or is unavailable, THEN THE system SHALL log the event with provider and failure detail, present a real-time status message to users with recommended alternatives (e.g. try again later, change method), and automatically escalate recurrent failures for operational investigation.\n- IF a user encounters a business rule breach (e.g., ordering out-of-stock, duplicate review submission, operation against ineligible product/order), THEN THE system SHALL block the action, inform the user of the explicit policy reason, and log the breach for review.\n- WHEN errors repeatedly occur for a user in one session (e.g., 3 failed payments, 3 failed logins), THE system SHALL provide context-sensitive suggestions (e.g., account recovery, support contact) and track the incident for risk monitoring.\n\n### 7.2 Performance\n- WHEN a user performs a main workflow action (register, login, search/browse, add to cart, update profile, submit order, review, or inquiry), THE system SHALL respond within 2 seconds for at least 95% of requests under normal load, as measured by operational analytics.\n- WHERE anticipated processing could exceed this threshold (complex bulk data, 3rd-party delay), THE system SHALL provide real-time progress feedback to the user and, where appropriate, offer asynchronous workflow completion notification by email/SMS/push.\n- THE system SHALL ensure that performance degradations, recurring bottlenecks, or error surges are automatically logged with contextual incident details, triggering administrator notifications as appropriate.\n\n## 8. Business Rules Summary\n- All data changes and transactions producing legal or audit-relevant consequences (orders, user information, reviews, seller credentials) SHALL be snapshot/audited at every significant workflow stage, including before-and-after state, timestamp, and acting user/role.\n- Customers, sellers, and administrators may only access or act on resources for which they have explicit permission, as per the real-time permissions matrix and role-based business policies; cross-role or unauthorized actions are strictly rejected and auditable.\n- All platform business processes involving time-sensitive workflows (reviews, order windows, payment expiration, inquiry SLA) SHALL utilize timezone-aware scheduling and messaging.\n- Multi-seller workflows involving order splitting, financial remittance, or analytics generation SHALL enforce atomic operation guarantees; partial completion, race conditions, or inconsistencies are strictly prohibited and must be detected for remediation.\n- Compliance with the full business logic and enforcement rules described herein is mandatory for all backend development work; full adherence to role-based security, input validation, error handling, and auditability guarantees long-term platform success and legal defensibility.\n\n---\n\nFor comprehensive requirements regarding user roles, permissions, and authentication policy, reference the [User Roles & Authentication Document](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md).

Role restrictions ensure only sellers create/edit their own products and only administrators may approve, reject, or archive listings. Every business process is auditable, atomic, and must prevent inconsistent or orphaned catalog states.\n\n### Product Creation, Editing & Submission\n- WHEN a seller initiates new product registration, THE system SHALL allow saving as draft, requiring at minimum: product title, category, images, price, descriptive details, origin, and at least one option set if applicable.\n- WHEN a seller edits an existing draft or live product, THE system SHALL present all validation errors to the seller in real time and flag required field omissions.\n- WHEN a seller submits a completed draft, THE system SHALL validate all business rules, including mandatory category mapping, inventory, min/max price, brand policies, and regional compliance.\n- IF submitted product data is invalid or incomplete, THEN THE system SHALL block progression, highlight all specific issues, and record the failure attempt in audit logs.\n- WHEN product is submitted successfully, THE system SHALL create a pending-approval version (not visible until approved) and alert administrators for review.\n\n### Approvals, Publishing, and Revisions\n- WHEN a product awaits approval, THE administrator SHALL receive an approval queue showing all required context (seller, timestamps, category, violation status).\n- WHEN an administrator reviews a listing, THE system SHALL allow approve, reject (with rationale), or request revision (with comments to seller).\n- IF a product is approved, THEN THE system SHALL publish to the appropriate channels with immutable audit record of all actions.\n- IF rejected, THEN THE system SHALL notify the seller, unlock for further edits, retain all previous content for review, and record the decision.\n- WHERE a published product requires update (e.g., price, images, options), THE system SHALL permit the seller to propose edits, which, if significant (per admin policy), SHALL route to an admin approval loop before re-publishing.\n\n### Deletion, Archival, and Restoration\n- WHEN a seller requests to delete a product, THE system SHALL require confirmation, impose a grace period (as per platform policy), and immediately hide the product from buyers.\n- WHEN an administrator archives a product (e.g., regulatory request), THE system SHALL mark the item read-only, prevent new transactions, and log reason and initiator.\n- WHEN a previously deleted or archived product is restored, THE system SHALL verify policy compliance, category/channel validity, and then reactivate the product after full business rule validation.\n\n### Error Handling and Auditability\n- IF any error occurs during creation, editing, or publishing, THEN THE system SHALL roll back to the previous valid state, record the error, and inform the seller/admin of resolution steps.\n- THE system SHALL capture a full audit trail including user, action, before/after states, version numbers, and all critical timestamps.\n- WHERE concurrent edits are detected, THE system SHALL require the user to review the latest state and reconcile changes before saving.\n- Performance: WHEN a product is submitted, THE system SHALL complete validation and admin notification within 2 seconds under normal operations.\n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Product Registration Workflow\"\n    A[\"Seller Creates Draft\"] --> B[\"Validate Draft Fields\"]\n    B --> C{\"Is Valid?\"}\n    C -->|\"Yes\"| D[\"Submit Draft\"]\n    C -->|\"No\"| E[\"Show Error & Stop\"]\n    D --> F[\"Await Admin Review\"]\n    F --> G{\"Admin Approves?\"}\n    G -->|\"Yes\"| H[\"Publish to Catalog\"]\n    G -->|\"No\"| I[\"Request Edits or Reject\"]\n    I --> B\n    H --> J[\"Product Live in Channel(s)\"]\n  end\n```\n\n## Category & Section Definition\n\n### Multi-Level Category Management\n- WHEN an administrator creates or modifies a category or section, THE system SHALL require unique name, parent (if applicable), display priority, navigational path, attribute set, and permissible product types.\n- THE administrator SHALL assign products to one or more categories or sections during initial registration, based on business requirements.\n- WHEN sellers assign products to categories, THE system SHALL validate seller's channel/section permissions and block assignment to unauthorized or restricted categories.\n- WHERE business rules require (e.g., regulated categories), THE system SHALL enforce additional validations, document requirements, or approval loops.\n- Category tree integrity: WHEN a category or section is moved, merged, or deleted, THE system SHALL automatically adjust affected product/category mappings, preserving referential integrity and atomicity.\n- IF cyclical, orphaned, or ambiguous category relationships are detected, THEN THE system SHALL block operation and require admin intervention; detailed errors must describe the problem.\n\n### Category Attribute Management\n- THE system SHALL enable administrators to define per-category attributes (e.g., required fields for Electronics vs. Apparel) and validation logic.\n- WHEN a new attribute is added to a category, THE system SHALL enforce retroactive validation for all products within that category, prompting required updates or approving mass exceptions by admin authority.\n- Permission Matrix:\n\n| Action                  | Customer | Seller | Administrator |\n|-------------------------|:--------:|:------:|:-------------:|\n| Browse/Filter Categories|    ✅     |   ✅   |      ✅        |\n| Assign Product to Cat.  |    ❌     |   ✅   |      ✅        |\n| Create/Edit Category    |    ❌     |   ❌   |      ✅        |\n| Attribute Definition    |    ❌     |   ❌   |      ✅        |\n| Section Ownership Edit  |    ❌     |   ✅   |      ✅        |\n\n## Product Bundling & Variants\n\n### Bundles\n- WHEN a seller creates a bundled product, THE system SHALL require bundle name, descriptive logic, component product list, and minimum/maximum sale quantities per business rules.\n- THE bundle SHALL be validated to ensure all component products are in stock, compatible, available for joint sale, and not subject to prohibited combinations (e.g., mutually exclusive promotions).\n- WHEN a bundle's component inventory drops below threshold, THE system SHALL mark the bundle as unavailable or partially available, depending on admin policy.\n- WHEN one or more components need to be removed (e.g., end-of-life, recall), THE administrator SHALL have the authority to update or retire bundles, with full audit logging.\n\n### Product Variants\n- Seller may register variants (e.g., Size, Color) with single or multi-select options, each mapped to distinct SKUs and inventory tracked atomically.\n- WHEN variants are registered or edited, THE system SHALL ensure no duplicate or conflicting option combinations, that at least one default is defined, and that inventory > 0 for saleable combinations.\n- IF a variant option set is incomplete, ambiguous, or violates business rules (e.g., negative/zero inventory, mis-mapped), THEN THE system SHALL block publishing and specifically identify constraints.\n- Error handling: IF an attempted variant edit impacts a live order or causes a SKU collision, THEN THE system SHALL alert responsible users, block the action, and escalate to admin if unresolved.\n\n## Option & Inventory Rules\n\n### Option Rules\n- Sellers define options (single/multi-select, default values, dependencies, constraints) when registering or editing products; these are strictly enforced throughout.\n- WHEN an option is dependent on another (e.g., only certain colors available in large size), THE system SHALL enforce valid only combinations, blocking all invalid submissions.\n- Each option value SHALL have a display label, user-facing description, and business purpose.\n\n### Inventory Rules\n- Inventory is managed atomically per option/SKU, sync across channels/sections\n- WHEN a sale/purchase event occurs, THE system SHALL atomically decrement inventory and block any operation leading to negative stock.\n- IF a stock update is attempted below zero, THEN THE system SHALL block the event, notify user, and flag for admin review.\n- THE system SHALL support restock, allocation, and hold mechanisms, with all changes audited, and shall provide threshold alerts for low stock.\n- WHEN a reserved item is canceled, THE system SHALL release corresponding inventory atomically; if operation fails, rollback is initiated and error is logged.\n- Error cases: IF inventory data is found inconsistent with sales/orders, THEN THE system SHALL lock the product, prevent further sales, and require admin resolution.\n- Performance: THE system SHALL complete inventory updates and concurrent stock validations within 1 second for routine operations (<1000 SKUs/event).\n\n## Snapshot History & Change Tracking\n\n- WHEN any significant (business-defined) product change occurs—such as price, inventory, options, category, publication status, or metadata—THE system SHALL create a timestamped, immutable snapshot capturing before and after states.\n- All product state transitions (draft, pending, approved, published, archived, deleted, restored) SHALL be snapshotted.\n- WHEN a user with restoration privileges initiates rollback, THE system SHALL reload the selected snapshot as a new proposed state, validate for policy compliance, and require confirmation before applying.\n- Audit history is viewable to authorized roles (admins, product owner sellers) and redacted for all others.\n- WHEN a rollback is requested that would violate current business rules (e.g., legacy price policy), THE system SHALL prompt review, block invalid rollback, and log the event in history.\n- IF a history entry is missing or cannot be accessed, THEN THE system SHALL report the issue, attempt to reconstruct from adjacent records, and escalate to administrators if full restoration is not possible.\n- History retention SHALL meet business-defined and legal compliance timelines; archived entries are purged or anonymized upon expiry—including handling of disputed or legal-hold items per policy.\n- Performance: WHEN loading snapshot or rollback, THE system SHALL complete state transition and present result to user (or failure) within 4 seconds for up to 1000 records.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Product Versioning & Rollback\"\n    A[\"Product Update Initiated\"] --> B[\"Create Snapshot\"]\n    B --> C{\"Is Significant Change?\"}\n    C -->|\"Yes\"| D[\"Log Change in History\"]\n    C -->|\"No\"| E[\"Skip/Keep Minimal Log\"]\n    D --> F[\"Allow Rollback by Role\"]\n    F --> G[\"Apply Policy-Based Validation\"]\n    G --> H{\"Compliant?\"}\n    H -->|\"Yes\"| I[\"Update Product State\"]\n    H -->|\"No\"| J[\"Show Error/Block Rollback\"]\n    I --> K[\"History Updated\"]\n  end\n```\n\n## Channel-Specific Mapping\n\n### Channel Mapping Workflow\n- Products may be assigned to multiple sales channels or sub-stores, each with specific attribute overrides, eligibility checks, and activation status per channel.\n- Sellers may only list products to channels/sections permitted in their authentication context.\n- WHEN mapping a product to a channel, THE system SHALL validate mandatory attributes, channel-specific business rules (e.g., pricing, compliance, language, imagery, regional/TOS restrictions), and overall consistency with the master product.\n- IF channel mapping fails, THEN THE system SHALL block mapping, specify all detected compliance/value errors, and allow fix/resubmit cycle.\n- WHEN a channel is disabled, THE system SHALL automatically inactivate all mapped products, notify sellers, and preserve history for auditing.\n- Activation/deactivation logic: THE administrator may enable/disable specific product-channel associations with atomic, audited events.\n- WHEN mass update/migration across channels occurs, THE system SHALL guarantee atomicity: partial updates are forbidden, and all-or-nothing validation applies.\n- Audit/traceability: Every channel-mapping change (creation, activation, deactivation, edits) SHALL be logged per record; all history is available for review by admins.\n- Performance: WHERE >1000 product-channel edits occur, THE system SHALL complete mapping operations within 10 seconds, with progress transparency for users/administrators.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Channel Mapping Process\"\n    A[\"Product Registered\"] --> B[\"Select Channels\"]\n    B --> C[\"Validate Channel Requirements\"]\n    C --> D{\"All Valid?\"}\n    D -->|\"Yes\"| E[\"Activate in Channels\"]\n    D -->|\"No\"| F[\"Show Compliance Error\"]\n    E --> G[\"Log/Notify All Events\"]\n    F --> B\n  end\n```\n\n## Glossary of Key Product & Catalog Terms\n\n- **Product**: A purchasable item managed by a seller and published by admin, encompassing all essential data (title, images, options, price, etc.) and backing audit/snapshot history.\n- **Category**: Multi-level grouping organizing products for browsing, search, filtering, and enforcing attribute/business rules. Each has unique policies and attribute sets.\n- **Section**: A logical or branded subdivision (e.g., seller store, featured area) with independent product selection, assigned permissions, and special policy enforcement.\n- **Bundle**: A composite product directly referencing multiple components, which may be unavailable for individual sale when bundled, enforcing atomicity of business logic.\n- **Variant**: A product with options, managed as uniquely tracked SKUs (e.g., color, size) and validated for completeness, no duplicates, and inventory accuracy.\n- **Option**: Selectable attribute (single, multi, dependency) which determines actual SKUs and inventory; all option rules enforced at point of registration, edit, and transaction.\n- **Inventory**: Quantity of available goods tracked atomically by SKU/option; negative or overcommitted stock is blocked by business rules.\n- **Snapshot/History**: Timestamped, immutable record of each meaningful state transition in a product’s lifecycle; supports audit, rollback, compliance, dispute resolution.\n- **Channel Mapping**: Assignment and validation process for products to be available/sellable under platform-specific, admin-defined, or third-party channels/affiliates.

Introduction\nOrder and Cart Management for shoppingMallAi covers all platform workflows from the point a user selects or saves items for potential purchase through successful order completion, shipping/fulfillment, after-service (returns/exchanges), and exceptional administration or error-handling scenarios. Requirements are expressed in EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format, addressing the complete set of business rules, multi-role permission dynamics, concurrency, edge-case handling, and audit/performance conditions needed for reliable enterprise-scale operation.\n\nUser roles for all flows in this process include:\n- **customer**: initiates cart activity, pushes through checkout, manages orders, requests returns/service.\n- **seller**: fulfills orders, updates product status, oversees shipping/after-service for respective items.\n- **administrator**: monitors all transactions, resolves disputes, possesses intervention authority in any step with audit logging.\n\n## 2. Cart Model & Session Handling\n### Cart Session Lifecycle\n- THE shoppingMallAi platform SHALL support both guest (anonymous) and authenticated user cart sessions, with transition/merge flows on login.\n- WHEN a non-authenticated user adds an item to cart, THE system SHALL create a temporary, device/browser-bound cart session expiring no more than 7 days after last cart activity.\n- WHEN a guest user logs in, THE system SHALL merge the anonymous cart with the user’s persistent cart using these rules:\n  - IF product and variant are duplicated, THEN THE system SHALL use the more recent quantity selection and update.\n  - IF a product present in guest cart is unavailable or delisted, THEN THE system SHALL exclude it during merge and notify the user.\n- WHEN a user logs out, THE system SHALL persist their cart state for retrieval within 30 days; cart is otherwise expired and archived thereafter.\n- WHEN an authenticated user’s session is active on multiple devices or browsers, THE system SHALL maintain cross-device cart state in near real time.\n- IF session expiration or cart inconsistency occurs, THEN THE system SHALL purge guest carts, archive authenticated ones, and enforce policy-defined concurrency rules prohibiting simultaneous conflicting cart operations from multiple devices.\n- WHERE device/browser cookies are unavailable, THE system SHALL create and securely manage an alternative session identifier to persist cart context.\n- WHEN an admin or seller needs to troubleshoot a customer cart issue, THE system SHALL provide cart audit and replay logs on request (access-controlled).\n\n### Cart Concurrency and Integrity\n- IF two sessions attempt conflicting updates to the same cart or item, THEN THE system SHALL enforce last-write-wins policy, log the event, and notify the user of conflicting actions.\n- THE system SHALL cap anonymous/guest cart size to a platform-defined limit (e.g., 50 items), returning explicit errors on overflow attempts.\n\n### Session Security and Auditability\n- WHEN a cart is accessed after inactivity exceeding the security policy limit, THE system SHALL require user re-authentication and verify cart validity against current product/inventory status.\n- THE system SHALL log all cart access, change, and merge events with timestamps, device, and user context for compliance audit.\n\n## 3. Cart Item Validations\n### Product and Option Eligibility\n- WHEN a product is added to cart, THE system SHALL validate inventory, minimum and maximum allowed purchase quantities, user eligibility for restricted items (e.g., age, membership, region), purchase windows, and product status.\n- IF requested inventory is lower than carted quantity, THEN THE system SHALL prevent the add or increase and display a detailed out-of-stock error.\n- WHEN a coupon, promotion, or automatic discount is applicable, THE system SHALL calculate discounted prices and update cart totals in real time, flagging eligibility per line item.\n- WHEN a product in an active cart is subject to price, option, or stock change, THE system SHALL notify user, deactivate affected offer, and force explicit confirmation during checkout.\n- WHERE bundled products or variants are used, THE system SHALL validate all bundle components/options for eligibility, independent pricing, and inventory.\n\n### Cart Item Editing, Removal, and Edge Cases\n- WHEN a user updates or removes cart item quantities, THE system SHALL enforce legal minimums (as defined by each product), maximums, and bundle integrity (e.g., cannot break mandatory bundles).\n- IF a change violates business or legal constraints (e.g., reduction below minimum quantity or addition exceeding per-person purchase cap), THEN THE system SHALL block the update and present a compliance message detailing the error and resolution path.\n- WHEN a system error, product de-listing, or ban affects items in user cart, THE system SHALL immediately flag the item, prevent checkout, and trigger an alert to both user and administrator for resolution.\n\n### Item-Level Audit and Admin Interventions\n- WHEN an administrator or seller investigates suspicious or failed cart operations, THE system SHALL expose full historical record of cart state changes, reason codes on failures, and user-level action logs for compliance review.\n\n## 4. Order Lifecycle (Create, Modify, Cancel)\n### Order Creation and State Transition\n- WHEN a customer proceeds from cart to checkout, THE system SHALL validate all cart items, customer eligibility, shipping method, payment means, and order/grand total before order instantiation.\n- WHEN order creation is invoked, THE system SHALL lock relevant cart line items, decrement ordered inventory atomically, and generate an unmodifiable order record with a unique global identifier. All time-sensitive coupon/promotions SHALL be re-validated at lock time.\n- THE system SHALL allow guest checkout only where business policy explicitly allows; guest orders SHALL be tracked by one-time tokens or verifiable non-member identifiers for order lookup/post-service.\n\n### Order Modification, Cancellation, and Splitting\n- WHILE an order remains in the 'created' or 'pending payment' state, THE customer SHALL be able to amend shipping information, apply new payment methods, or cancel the order with no penalty.\n- AFTER payment completes, THE customer MAY request modification or cancellation (e.g., changing address, order cancellation) only if fulfillment/shipping initiation has not started; this SHALL require seller or administrator approval, with a locked audit log.\n- IF the order is handed to a shipper (status = 'fulfilled'), THEN further modifications are disallowed except as part of defined after-service scenarios.\n- WHEN an order contains items from multiple sellers/vendors, THE system SHALL create a parent-child structure in which each sub-order is fulfilled, invoiced, and tracked independently. The parent order reflects aggregate state and exception escalation (e.g., partially canceled/refunded orders). All sub-order transitions SHALL trigger notifications and state synchronization to parent.\n- WHEN an admin or seller intervenes in an active order (manual adjustment, forced cancellation), THE system SHALL log all changes, reasons, initiators, and synchronize updates to all relevant parties in real time.\n\n#### Order State Transition Diagram\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Cart Created\"] --> B[\"Checkout Initiated\"]\n  B --> C[\"Order Placed\"]\n  C --> D[\"Payment Processing\"]\n  D -->|\"Success\"| E[\"Order Confirmed\"]\n  D -->|\"Failure\"| F[\"Payment Failed\"]\n  E --> G[\"Fulfillment Pending\"]\n  G --> H[\"Shipped\"]\n  H --> I[\"Delivered\"]\n  E -->|\"Customer Cancel\"| X[\"Order Cancelled\"]\n  F --> X\n  G -->|\"Cancel Before Ship\"| X\n  H -->|\"Return/AS\"| J[\"After-Service/Return Handling\"]\n```\n\n## 5. Payment Workflow\n### Payment Initiation, Methods, and Validation\n- WHEN order confirmation is invoked, THE system SHALL validate order eligibility, start a payment session (committing currency, shipping, coupon, deposit/mileage, partial payment use), and initiate real-time transaction tracking with the selected payment provider.\n- THE system SHALL support at minimum card, direct bank transfer, virtual account, and electronic wallet payment methods; payment policy for eligibility and constraints on method selection SHALL be definable per product, seller, and order type.\n- IF payment is abandoned, fails, or times out, THEN the corresponding order SHALL remain in the 'pending payment' state until timeout expiry (default: 30 minutes), subject to automatic or user-initiated retry, after which order and associated inventory locks SHALL be released and the user notified of expiration.\n- WHERE partial payments or deposits apply (e.g., pre-orders, installments, mileage use), THE system SHALL restrict fulfillment activity to completed payment balance, show outstanding amounts prominently, and prohibit split fulfillment until all terms are satisfied.\n- WHEN a payment rollback, refund, or chargeback is signed by a provider, THE system SHALL update the order state to 'payment reverted,' notify all parties, and release held inventory immediately.\n- WHEN system detects suspicious payment patterns (multiple failed attempts, fraudulent signals), THE order SHALL be locked, flagged for administrator review, and further activity temporarily suspended until resolved; all such actions SHALL be logged with fraud markers for audit.\n\n### Admin and Audit Controls\n- WHEN an administrator or authorized auditor requests, THE payment history, session logs, and transaction status of any order SHALL be retrievable with complete timestamps, provider references, and audit chain.\n\n## 6. Fulfillment, Shipping, and Split Orders\n### Fulfillment Workflow and Shipping Options\n- WHEN payment is confirmed, THE system SHALL create fulfillment tasks for each seller or warehouse, assigning order references, fulfillment SLAs, and notification triggers.\n- WHERE a single order includes goods from multiple vendors or locations, THE system SHALL split into sub-orders for independent fulfillment, shipment, receipt confirmation, and after-service actions, recording all parent/child relationships and updating the parent order state on resolution or exception.\n- THE system SHALL permit buyers to select among shipping options (standard, express, local delivery, store pickup) subject to business and product constraints and dynamically calculate delivery estimates.\n- WHEN shipped, the system SHALL record carrier, tracking information, expected delivery date, and auto-notify user status changes via preferred channel.\n- IF carrier pickup fails or a delivery error occurs, THEN the system SHALL immediately notify both seller and buyer, escalate in-system issue tickets per SLA, and allow admin mediation.\n\n### Delivery and Split Shipment Exceptions\n- WHERE order items require staggered fulfillment or are sourced from different stock locations, THE system SHALL handle split or batch deliveries, update user at each step, and synchronize order state on completion.\n- IF a seller or admin needs to adjust fulfillment timing (e.g., delay due to supply chain issues), THE system SHALL record all timing shifts, notify affected users, and provide next-step remediation guidance.\n\n#### Split Order & Child Shipping Flow Diagram\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Parent Order\"\n    P[\"Order Confirmed\"]\n    P --> S1[\"Sub-Order (Seller 1)\"]\n    P --> S2[\"Sub-Order (Seller 2)\"]\n  end\n  S1 --> F1[\"Fulfillment/Ship\"]\n  S2 --> F2[\"Fulfillment/Ship\"]\n  F1 --> R1[\"Delivered/Return/AS\"]\n  F2 --> R2[\"Delivered/Return/AS\"]\n  R1 --> P\n  R2 --> P\n```\n\n## 7. After-Service (Returns, Refunds, Repairs, Disputes)\n### Customer-Initiated Return, Exchange, and After-Service\n- WHEN a customer requests return, exchange, or repair, THE system SHALL require order reference, item(s), reason code, and supporting evidence/documentation (e.g., images for damage claim) as per context.\n- THE return/exchange/request window (e.g., 7 days from delivery, or per product policy) SHALL be strictly enforced; expired or ineligible cases SHALL be refused with a detailed message and escalation route.\n- WHERE partial returns/exchanges are supported, THE system SHALL only accept and process valid items/quantities, generate pro-rata refund amounts, and update parent/child order statuses upon completion.\n- IF return is approved, THEN THE system SHALL generate a return shipping label (where applicable), monitor RMA progress, and guarantee refund within business policy (default: 5 business days) after item inspection and validation.\n- WHEN items are lost or damaged in shipment or return, THE responsible user (buyer or seller as per incident) SHALL upload photographic or documentary support, and the system SHALL attach all evidence for admin arbitration.\n- IF return/exchange/AS is denied (e.g., misuse, policy violation, expired period), THEN THE system SHALL state denial reason clearly, detail remedial steps, and allow the customer to escalate to administrator for final review.\n\n### Administrator and Seller Interventions\n- WHEN seller or admin must intervene in a stale, disputed, or ambiguous after-service claim, THE system SHALL record all communication and resolution actions as part of the case file, securing audit trails and user access as appropriate to privacy and business policy.\n\n#### After-Service Return Workflow Diagram\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Return & After-Service\"\n    AA[\"Customer Initiates Return/AS\"] --> BB[\"Upload Reason/Evidence\"]\n    BB --> CC[\"System Validates Eligibility/Window\"]\n    CC -->|\"Eligible\"| DD[\"Admin/Seller Review\"]\n    CC -->|\"Ineligible\"| EE[\"Denial & Escalation Option\"]\n    DD -->|\"Approved\"| FF[\"Return Label/Shipment\"]\n    FF --> GG[\"Item Inspected\"]\n    GG -->|\"Approved\"| HH[\"Refund/Resolution Complete\"]\n    GG -->|\"Rejected\"| II[\"Dispute/Escalation\"]\n  end\n```\n\n## 8.

Error Handling, User-Facing Recovery, and Edge-Case Scenarios\n### Error Scenarios from Cart to Delivery\n- IF session expires, cart data is corrupted, or user data becomes inconsistent, THEN THE system SHALL trigger re-authentication, attempt state recovery, and flag users for support follow-up.\n- IF payment gateway is unavailable at checkout, THEN THE system SHALL place the order in a 'pending payment' state and prompt the user to retry or switch payment options, retaining cart locks for session duration.\n- IF item becomes out-of-stock, price/option changes, or legal restriction is updated between cart and checkout (e.g., product recall/ban), THEN THE system SHALL block the affected item(s), require explicit user action, and log the event for all affected parties/roles.\n- IF carrier loses or delays delivery, THEN THE system SHALL auto-notify buyer and seller with estimated resolution or escalation pathway, and alert administrator if not resolved in business SLA.\n- WHEN user attempts to perform actions outside their permissions (e.g., unauthorized order access, admin-forced edits by non-admins), THE system SHALL deny access, record the attempt, and present actionable errors (with references to support or escalation as needed).\n- IF an order or after-service becomes stale due to user/role inaction, THEN THE system SHALL remind relevant parties and escalate to admin if not resolved per timeline.\n\n### Comprehensive Exception and Audit Recovery\n- WHEN error rates or anomalies exceed platform thresholds in any process (payment failure rate, split order collision, return fraud), THE system SHALL escalate to administrators, surface actionable metrics, and create real-time incident tracking for all affected workflows.\n\n---\nSee related requirements and role definitions in the [User Roles and Authentication Guide](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md), [Core Functional Requirements Specification](./03-core-functional-requirements.md), [Discounts, Payments, and Financial Flows Specification](./06-discounts-payments-and-financial-flows.md), and [Performance, Error Handling, and Usability Specification](./11-performance-error-handling-and-usability.md).\n"},{"reason":"To specify the business rules, types, and usage policies for discounts, coupons, deposit/mileage, and all associated financial flows within the platform.","filename":"06-discounts-payments-and-financial-flows.md","documentType":"requirement","outline":["Discount & Coupon Issuance and Redemption","Rule-based Eligibility & Restrictions","Deposit/Mileage Charging and Use","Payment Validation Procedures","Fraud and Abuse Prevention"],"audience":"development team","keyQuestions":["How do discounts/coupons work?","How are payments managed and secured?"],"detailLevel":"detailed specification","constraints":["Coupon and payment flows in EARS format"],"content":"# 1. Overview and Scope\nshoppingMallAi rewards and incentivizes user participation and frequent purchasing by providing a robust system for discounts, coupon management, and deposit/mileage handling, while ensuring robust payments and fraud prevention. This document comprehensively details business rules and operational flows for these financial features to guarantee precise, repeatable, and secure implementation across all user roles.\n\n# 2. Discount & Coupon Issuance and Redemption\n\n## Coupon and Discount Types\nTHE platform SHALL support the following types of discounts and coupons: \n- Single-use coupons (once per user per campaign)\n- Multi-use coupons (limited or unlimited use per user)\n- Time-limited discount events (date range, time-of-day)\n- Seller-issued coupons (seller-specific, product/category limited)\n- Administrator-issued coupons (platform-wide or targeted)\n- Order-level discounts (e.g., 10% off total)\n- Product-level discounts (e.g., $X off specific products)\n\n## Issuance Procedures\nWHEN administrators or sellers initiate a coupon event, THE system SHALL allow configuration of all the following:\n- Start and end date/times\n- Eligible roles (customer, seller)\n- Eligible products, categories, or order conditions\n- Redemption channel (site-wide, mobile only, specific seller)\n- Maximum total issuance count and per-user quota\n- Minimum purchase amount or other qualifying conditions\n\n## Redemption Rules\nWHEN a customer applies a coupon or discount code to an order, THE system SHALL validate the following BEFORE applying:\n  - Coupon code authenticity and status\n  - Date/time window (active?)\n  - User's role/eligibility\n  - Channel and product eligibility\n  - Minimum spend condition\n  - Per-user usage quota\n  - Seller participation/opt-in (for seller-issued)\n  - Stackability with other offers (set by coupon issuer)\n\nTHE system SHALL deduct the correct amount from the order total when all validations pass.\n\n## Post-Redeem Processing\nWHEN a coupon is redeemed, THE system SHALL decrement available usage (total, per-user), update status, and log the redemption with: userId, couponId, timestamp, applied orderId, and any special notes.\n\nIF coupon validation fails at any point, THEN THE system SHALL record error details (userId, couponId, attempted order, error code) and return an explicit error to the user.\n\n## Coupon Status Lifecycle\nTHE system SHALL track all coupons in one of these states: issued, active, suspended, expired, redeemed, revoked, deleted.\nWHEN a coupon reaches expiry date, THE system SHALL update status to expired and prevent further redemption.\n\n# 3. Rule-Based Eligibility & Restrictions\n\n## User and Order Eligibility\n- WHEN defining a coupon, THE creator SHALL specify eligible user roles (customer, seller, etc.), purchase history requirements, or membership levels.\n- WHERE a coupon is target-specific (e.g., first purchase), THE system SHALL prevent redemption by users who do not meet criteria.\n- WHEN a user attempts to apply multiple discounts, THE system SHALL enforce stackability rules (yes/no, priority, max discounts per order).\n- WHEN a coupon or discount is meant for a specific product/category, THE system SHALL validate inclusion in the user's current order.\n\n## Limitations\n- THE system SHALL enforce per-user and global issuance/redeem quotas for all coupons and event discounts.\n- IF quota exceeded, THEN THE system SHALL prevent further redemption and inform the user (with code: COUPON_QUOTA_EXCEEDED).\n- WHEN users attempt to redeem expired/suspended/revoked coupons, THE system SHALL deny application and return appropriate codes (e.g., COUPON_INVALID, COUPON_EXPIRED, etc.).\n\n# 4. Deposit/Mileage Charging and Use\n\n## Charging (Acquisition)\n- WHEN a user completes qualifying transactions, event participation, or receives admin/seller grants, THE system SHALL credit mileage or deposit points to user’s account, logging: userId, source, amount, timestamp, and event context.\n- WHEN a customer cancels/refunds an order, THE system SHALL reclaim any bonus mileage/deposit granted from that order.\n- THE system SHALL separate mileage earned (non-cash, event-based) and deposits charged (cash-equivalent, can be withdrawn if allowed).\n\n## Usage (Redemption)\n- WHEN making eligible purchases, THE system SHALL allow the user to select the amount of deposit/mileage to apply (subject to rules per transaction).\n- THE system SHALL validate sufficient balance for requested usage.\n- THE system SHALL apply maximum usage constraints per order/product, as defined by admin or event rules.\n- AFTER transaction, THE system SHALL deduct the applied amount and log the usage (userId, transactionId, amount, timestamp).\n- IF attempted usage exceeds available balance, THEN THE system SHALL reject with code: INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE.\n\n# 5. Payment Validation Procedures\n\n## Core Payment Process\n1. User initializes cart checkout, selecting payment method (card, transfer, mobile, 3rd party, split, etc.).\n2. System verifies cart contents, discounts/coupons, and available applicable deposits/mileage.\n3. User authorizes payment – THE system SHALL tokenize and securely store payment intent/session.\n4. THE system SHALL validate payment authorization with external providers (acquiring bank, wallet, etc.), following real-time confirmation (or asynch callback for certain methods).\n5. THE system SHALL record successful payment confirmation with: userId, paymentId, method, amount, status, timestamp, and orderId.\n\n## Validation Rules\n- WHEN payment is initiated, THE system SHALL check validity (order totals, discounts, coupon stacking, taxes, shipping).\n- WHEN payment authorization fails, THEN THE system SHALL present user-friendly code (PAYMENT_FAILED, INVALID_METHOD, FRAUD_SUSPECTED) and record full failure details.\n- WHERE refunds or partial cancellations arise, THE system SHALL validate refund/exchange rules (e.g., coupon reversals, deposit returns, pro-rata calculations).\n- EVERY financial transaction (including deposits/withdrawals, coupon/mileage applications) SHALL be auditable with unique ids and tamper-evident logs.\n\n# 6. Fraud and Abuse Prevention\n\n## Anti-Abuse Controls\n- WHEN issuing or redeeming coupons/mileage, THE system SHALL:\n  - Detect duplicate or suspicious account creation/usage patterns\n  - Track IP/device fingerprinting for anomalous access\n  - Set global and per-user thresholds for redemption/issuance\n  - Suspend, revoke, or blacklist accounts based on violation triggers\n- THE system SHALL limit coupon grants to certified sellers and administrators only.\n- ALL bulk coupon issuances SHALL require justification notes and administrative approval log.\n\n## Real-Time Monitoring\n- THE system SHALL log every coupon/deposit/payment event with enough metadata to backtrack for investigation.\n- THE system SHALL surface suspicious patterns (rapid redemptions, high refund-to-purchase ratios, known fraud IPs/devices) to administrators for action.\n\n# 7. Business Rules & Best Practices\n\n- All financial events (discount/mileage/payment/refund) SHALL be recorded atomically and consistently.\n- System SHALL support audit trails for all financial operations for compliance and dispute resolution.\n- Administrators SHALL have dashboards to review, suspend, or revoke coupons, oversee deposit/mileage campaigns, and monitor suspected fraud/abuse.\n- System SHALL separate internal accounting (for reporting/compliance) from customer-facing balances and events.\n\n# 8. Performance Expectations\n\n- THE system SHALL process coupon eligibility and apply payment logic instantly (sub-2 seconds for >99% flows, <=5 seconds for complex scenarios or third-party payment provider dependencies).\n- User balance and order updates SHALL be atomic and reflect in real time following every transaction event.\n- All errors involving user actions (coupon, payment, deposit) SHALL display in real time with actionable codes.\n\n# 9. Error Handling Scenarios\n\n- IF a coupon is invalid, expired, or revoked, THEN THE system SHALL prevent usage and provide a clear user message with error code (COUPON_INVALID, COUPON_EXPIRED, etc.).\n- IF user attempts to pay with milage/deposit that is insufficient, THEN THE system SHALL block the transaction with INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE.\n- IF payment processor fails or times out, THEN THE system SHALL surface PAYMENT_UNAVAILABLE or PAYMENT_TIMEOUT with clear next steps.\n- IF fraud/abuse is detected, THEN THE system SHALL block transactions, trigger admin notification, and log all relevant data for further review.\n\n# 10.

Introduction\nComprehensive requirements for attachment and file management in the shoppingMallAi platform. Defines required business logic, user scenarios, workflows, permissions, error handling, compliance, and lifecycle rules for all asset types (images, documents, evidence, invoices, etc.). Written for backend development teams. All requirements employ EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax). Scope includes roles (customer, seller, administrator) and all business objects interacting with file workflows.\n\n## 2. Attachment Principles and Objective\nAttachments/files are business-critical data enabling:\n- Product presentation and catalog asset management\n- Legal evidence for transactions, disputes, regulatory compliance\n- User-driven interaction (community posts, reviews, inquiries)\n- Seller onboarding/verification, compliance fulfillment\n- Secure, privacy-aligned information exchange (receipts, contracts, invoices)\nUnification across domains is mandatory for platform integrity, audit, and performance. All handling must comply with business, legal, and user-experience standards.\n\n## 3. File Upload and Handling Policies\n### Role-based Upload Access\n- WHERE a user is a customer, seller, or administrator, THE system SHALL provide secure upload endpoints for each permitted file/attachment type per business rules.\n- WHERE file upload is triggered by 3rd-party API or partner system, THE system SHALL apply identical validation and audit policy as for direct uploads.\n- WHEN bulk-upload/import occurs (seller mass product asset, admin data import), THE system SHALL apply file-level validation, bulk error reporting, and partial success tracking.\n\n### File Validation and Security\n- WHEN a file is uploaded, THE system SHALL validate type (extension, MIME), size, and perform synchronous virus/malware and content scan.\n- IF a file fails content scanning, THEN THE system SHALL block the file, record event context, and escalate to relevant roles for review.\n- WHEN a file passes all validation, THE system SHALL assign a unique file identifier, extract standard metadata, and store in a secure, segregated tier appropriate to business context.\n- WHERE uploads exceed per-user or domain-configured quota, THE system SHALL reject the upload, trigger notification, and provide quota usage status to the user/role.\n- WHEN a seller or admin performs a bulk import, THE system SHALL throttle requests above defined concurrency rate and require progress/failure tracking.\n\n### Size, Type, and Special Content Policy\n| Attachment Type     | Allowed Extensions      | Max Size (MB)       | Notes                                            |\n|--------------------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Product Image      | jpg, jpeg, png, webp   | 10                 | Primary, thumbnail, variant images                |\n| Post/Review Media  | jpg, png, gif, pdf     | 5                  | Community features, reviews, inquiries            |\n| Seller Docs        | pdf, docx, xlsx        | 20                 | Business licenses, compliance docs                |\n| Transaction Invoice| pdf                    | 5                  | Payment, delivery receipts                        |\n| Dispute Evidence   | jpg, png, pdf          | 10                 | Complaints, legal evidence                       |\n| External Import    | Defined per API/partner| 50 (default)        | Subject to integration agreements                 |\n\n- WHEN a file exceeds allowable size/type, THE system SHALL immediately reject the upload and inform the user/role via explicit business error code.\n- IF upload error occurs due to system capacity, THEN THE system SHALL retry up to N times with escalating delay (configurable), and inform on repeated failures.\n\n### Logging, Monitoring, and Audit\n- THE system SHALL maintain immutable audit records for every upload (user, role, time, IP/device, file, domain context, event result, anomaly flag).\n- WHERE suspicious or abusive upload patterns are detected (e.g., rapid failures, known bad files), THE system SHALL flag accounts and restrict further upload attempts pending admin intervention.\n\n### Performance and Scalability\n- WHEN an upload <10MB is initiated, THE system SHALL fully process validation and commit the file within 3 seconds 99% of business hours.\n- WHERE attachment is accessed by customer-facing business processes (catalog, receipt, dispute, contract), THE system SHALL deliver file/image via CDN in <1 second 99% of standard user requests, up to 5,000 concurrent connections.\n- WHERE bulk import/export jobs are in progress, THE system SHALL estimate time remaining and offer users/admins real-time monitoring and progress error breakdowns.\n\n## 4. Attachment Types, Roles, and Workflows\n| Type                | Purposes                                         | Permitted Roles                | Requires Legal/Audit Flag |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Product Image       | Catalog, options, variant visuals                | seller, administrator         | No                       |\n| Post/Review Media   | Community, UGC, evidence, inquiry                | customer, administrator       | Yes (if evidence)        |\n| Seller Doc          | Onboarding, compliance, contracts                | seller, administrator         | Yes                      |\n| Transaction Invoice | Receipt, proof, record                           | seller, administrator         | Yes                      |\n| Dispute Evidence    | Moderation, legal, arbitration                   | customer, seller, admin       | Always                   |\n| API Attachment      | External import/proof (logistics, KYC)           | partner, admin                | Yes                      |\n\n### Domain-specific EARS Use Cases\n- WHEN a seller registers a new product, THE system SHALL require at least one valid product image before allowing publication.\n- WHEN a customer posts a review with an image, THE system SHALL verify and atomically link media in real time.\n- WHERE seller onboarding or renewal is in progress, THE system SHALL prevent process completion if any required compliance attachment is missing or invalid.\n- WHEN an admin reviews a dispute or order issue, THE system SHALL present every associated evidence file in an unalterable history pane.\n- WHERE a compliance deletion/withdrawal request is processed, THE system SHALL anonymize and/or purge attachments subject to retention/legal hold bracketing.\n\n## 5. Metadata, Ownership, and Access Control\n### Metadata Assignment\nTHE system SHALL assign to each file:\n- Uploader role (customer, seller, admin, partner)\n- Unique user ID\n- File type, extension, original name, business domain\n- Content hash/checksum\n- Upload and last-access timestamps\n- Associated entity reference (product, order, user, ticket, etc.)\n- Legal/audit/sensitivity flags if mandated by process\n\n### Ownership, Delegation, and Access\n- WHEN user attempts to access a file, THE system SHALL check context-based ACL (Access Control List) using role, business object, and file sensitivity flag.\n- WHERE attachment is sensitive/private, THE system SHALL restrict access to issuer, authorized administrator, or named delegate(s). All access events are logged.\n- IF a non-permitted party requests access to a restricted attachment, THEN THE system SHALL deny access, log the event, and provide business-explained error.\n- WHEN a guest user or expired account requests file access, THE system SHALL respond with \"resource unavailable\" and mask all identifying metadata.\n- WHERE group/shared access is permitted (e.g., multi-seller order, arbitration), THE system SHALL dynamically update permitted roles upon resolution updates.\n- IF a user is legally entitled to data deletion (e.g., after GDPR Right to Erasure request), THEN THE system SHALL anonymize or destroy attachments after retention period or legal clearance, logging all actions.\n\n### Visibility and Retention\n- WHILE disputes, reviews, or onboarding is pending, THE system SHALL enforce evidence/file masking for all unauthorized parties.\n- IF file access status changes (resolved, legal/unlock), THEN THE system SHALL update visibility and notify stakeholders by secure event feed.\n\n## 6. Versioning, History, and Audit Trail\n- WHEN a file is overwritten or replaced, THE system SHALL preserve all previous versions, marking only the latest as active and flagging any as evidence when required.\n- THE system SHALL provide immutable audit trail for all order/dispute/contract attachments, including every access, edit, or deletion event.\n- WHERE files are part of legal or compliance process, THE system SHALL lock record from deletion (except admin-initiated or court-ordered) and preserve chain-of-custody.\n- IF file version rollback is triggered by authorized user, THEN THE system SHALL record rationale and apply only upon secondary admin confirmation.\n- WHERE evidence/audit files are required for more than X years by law, THE system SHALL not delete or anonymize until expiration is validated and legal hold is removed by governance contact.\n\n## 7. File Delivery, CDN, and Retention Management\n- THE system SHALL route all public/document assets through CDN, with regional edge caching per service policy.\n- WHEN a file's business/core retention period ends (e.g., 24 months post-order closure), THE system SHALL flag as \"expired\" and initiate archival or deletion per policy; files under legal hold are exempted.\n- WHERE external retention is contractually required (API partner, logistics, seller agreement), THE system SHALL synchronize retention timetable and embargo with upstream provider.\n- WHEN CDN or storage edge nodes are unavailable, THE system SHALL queue all access/delivery attempts for retry, and proactively escalate extended outages to platform administration.\n\n## 8. Error Handling and Disaster Scenarios\n### Error/Incident Handling (EARS)\n- IF a file is missing, corrupted, or otherwise unavailable, THEN THE system SHALL provide business-explained error messages to requesters (\"Asset permanently unavailable. For dispute or refund provide alternate evidence.\")\n- IF repeat failures or malware triggers occur, THEN THE system SHALL blacklist file hash and/or source, lock user for review, and alert admin.\n- IF a retention/archival error is detected, THEN THE system SHALL lock all affected files, prevent deletion, and notify compliance roles.\n- IF an upload or download cannot complete within defined SLA due to system or 3rd-party error, THEN THE system SHALL queue and retry job, and present user/admin with ongoing status and remediation path.\n- WHEN catastrophic/system data loss is detected (disaster recovery), THE system SHALL attempt automated fail-over to backup and log all recovery events; if unsuccessful, notify administrators for urgent intervention.\n- IF an account is offboarded (user withdrawal, seller departure), THEN THE system SHALL lock all non-public files to access except to admin/compliance roles for mandated retention period, and trigger scheduled purging/anonymization.\n- WHERE data privacy breach is detected (unauthorized access to sensitive files), THE system SHALL lock access, inform compliance roles, notify affected users, and maintain full incident log for audit.\n\n## 9. Advanced Scenarios: Integrations, Policy, Extensibility\n- WHEN third-party/partner system uploads assets (e.g., KYC proof, logistics photo), THE system SHALL validate according to business domain and trigger appropriate workflow (verification, evidence, contract proof).\n- IF plugin/module (e.g., AI watermarking, evidence assessment) inserts/edits attachment data, THEN THE system SHALL log full context and maintain modifiability/auditability per process.\n- WHEN admin imports data via API/bulk interface, THE system SHALL apply equivalent business validation, logging, and bulk failover as for direct roles.\n- WHERE legal/policy changes trigger retention schedule revision, THE system SHALL apply updated policy to all relevant files from that point forward, retaining prior records per historical agreement.\n\n## 10.

Legal, privacy, and compliance rules must take precedence in ambiguity or dispute.\n\n\n"},{"reason":"To comprehensively specify all system-wide and domain-specific business rules, validation logic, and lifecycle constraints for enforceable, maintainable operation.","filename":"10-business-rules-and-domain-logic.md","documentType":"requirement","outline":["Cross-cutting Business Rules","Domain-specific Validation","Data Integrity (Snapshots, Audit Trails)","Coupon, Order, Inventory Policies","Refund, Cancellation, and Return Policies"],"audience":"development team","keyQuestions":["What business rules/legal logic must the backend enforce?"],"detailLevel":"detailed specification","constraints":["All enforceable rules must use EARS format"],"content":"# Business Rules and Domain Logic for shoppingMallAi\n\n## Introduction\nAll system-wide and domain-specific business rules, validation logic, and lifecycle constraints guiding shoppingMallAi operations are specified below using EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) for clarity, testability, and unambiguous backend implementation. Business requirements are comprehensive and actionable, covering all roles (customer, seller, administrator) and supporting full enforcement, auditability, and business integrity.\n\n> Business requirements only. Technical implementation (architecture, schemas, APIs, etc.) is at development team discretion.\n\nReference for domain and workflow boundaries:  \n- [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md)  \n- [Core Functional Requirements](./03-core-functional-requirements.md)  \n- [Discounts, Payments and Financial Flows](./06-discounts-payments-and-financial-flows.md)  \n- [Product & Catalog Management](./04-product-and-catalog-management.md)  \n- [Performance, Error Handling, and Usability](./11-performance-error-handling-and-usability.md)  \n\n## 1. Cross-cutting Business Rules\n\n### Unique Identity and Reference Integrity\n- THE system SHALL guarantee globally unique identifiers for every user, seller, product, order, coupon, and payment throughout entity lifecycle.\n- WHEN an entity is created, THE system SHALL check for identifier collisions and reject non-unique references, returning a user-facing message indicating conflict.\n- IF duplicate identifiers are detected, THEN THE system SHALL block creation, escalate to administrators, and require corrective review.\n\n### Role-based Access and Action Authorization\n- WHERE user role restricts operations (e.g., only sellers may update product pricing, only administrators may approve sellers), THE system SHALL check permissions referencing the [Role-Based Permissions Matrix](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md) before allowing each business function.\n- IF a user attempts an unauthorized action, THEN THE system SHALL deny the request, log the attempt with full context (user, role, timestamp, attempted action), and show a precise error message referencing insufficient permissions.\n- WHEN a user is marked suspended, banned, or has not met tenure or verification policies, THE system SHALL restrict access to all actions not permitted by status until eligibility is restored.\n- WHERE an administrator changes role assignments or updates platform-wide permissions, THE system SHALL enforce changes immediately or upon next session, according to policy, and log the event.\n\n### Data Auditability and Non-repudiation\n- THE system SHALL record all creation, modification, and deletion of critical business entities (order, inventory, reviews, payouts, coupons, attachments) as audit events, with actor, action, timestamp, and before/after state.\n- WHEN a critical business event occurs (compliance, moderation, legal, financial, or workflow-impacting change), THE system SHALL snapshot the prior state and ensure traceability for regulatory retention period.\n- IF an audit or data integrity violation is detected (e.g., unauthorized edit, unexpected rollback, tampering), THEN THE system SHALL flag, mark, and escalate the record for risk review, locking further changes as per [Performance, Error Handling, and Usability](./11-performance-error-handling-and-usability.md).\n\n### Anti-Fraud Controls and Abuse Prevention\n- WHEN indicators of fraud or abuse (multiple failed payments, coupon redemption surges, cancellation spikes, identity patterns, or statistically abnormal behavior) are detected, THE system SHALL flag suspicious accounts, orders, or actions, suspend or restrict automatically per escalation policy, and log a risk incident for administrative review.\n- WHERE an automated risk trigger is escalated, THE system SHALL allow administrators to review, lift, or extend restrictions with an audit record.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Domain-specific Validation\n\n### Registration and Account Management\n- WHEN a user registers, THE system SHALL validate unique email and mobile, enforce minimum password requirements, apply registration flow matching user role, and confirm terms and privacy acceptance.\n- IF an existing email or phone is found during registration, THEN THE system SHALL block registration, message the cause, and provide password reset or sign-in guidance.\n- WHERE registration uses OAuth/external provider, THE system SHALL map to a unique internal user and prevent account duplication/merge errors per [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md).\n- WHEN a seller registers, THE system SHALL require additional identity verification (business documentation, bank, contact), mark the user as 'pending verification', and suspend commerce until administrator approval.\n- WHEN an account is suspended, banned, or withdrawn, THE system SHALL enforce logical deletion/anonymization for personal data, retaining legally necessary records only.\n\n### Seller Verification and Product Management\n- WHEN a seller attempts to create, update, or delete a product, THE system SHALL validate all business-required fields: title, price, category, inventory, main image, description, variant/options, and compliance flags.\n- IF a prohibited, restricted, or incomplete listing is submitted, THEN THE system SHALL block the listing/update and return an actionable, domain-specific error message.\n- WHERE a product has options or variants, THE system SHALL require unique SKUs, independence of inventory per variant, and enforce all mapping and integrity constraints as in [Product & Catalog Management](./04-product-and-catalog-management.md).\n- WHEN a product is withdrawn or deactivated by a seller, THE system SHALL update catalog state, remove purchase or cart eligibility, and retain change history snapshot for audit.\n- WHEN an administrator modifies category, section, or structural attributes, THE system SHALL cascade business rule compliance revalidation on all associated products.\n\n### Order Creation, Checkout, and Fulfillment\n- WHERE a customer places an order, THE system SHALL validate product existence, price, availability, seller status, and that inventory is sufficient, considering minimum and maximum per-customer and per-SKU purchase limits.\n- WHEN an order is submitted, THE system SHALL prevent duplicate submissions or accidental double ordering by invalidating repeated attempts within a protected session window.\n- IF item availability changes between cart and checkout (e.g., stock reduced, option no longer valid), THEN THE system SHALL block checkout, present updated availability to the customer, and allow adjustment of the cart.\n- WHILE an order is in defined modifiable states (e.g., prior to shipment), THE system SHALL allow only permitted field edits (address, contact, payment method) and block action if current status prohibits it.\n- WHERE multi-vendor or split fulfillment applies, THE system SHALL maintain atomicity of each sub-order lifecycle, ensuring global order state accuracy (review [Order & Cart Management](./05-order-and-cart-management.md)).\n\n### Review, Inquiry, and Community Content\n- WHEN a customer submits a review, inquiry, or community post, THE system SHALL check eligibility (purchase completed, return window, policy criteria), enforce minimum/maximum content length, restrict use of banned/prohibited keywords, and snapshot each version.\n- IF spam, fraudulent, or prohibited reviews/inquiries are detected (multi-account, automated posting, repeated abuse, or content matching banlists), THEN THE system SHALL suspend user content privileges, flag account for admin review, and record all infractions.\n- WHERE content has attachment (image, file, doc), THE system SHALL enforce file type, size, and security scans as in [Attachment and File Management](./09-attachment-and-file-management.md), log all uploads/downloads, notify owner and admin of violations, and restrict sharing on policy breach or violation.\n- WHEN moderation or legal review is performed, THE system SHALL snapshot all edits, removals, and moderator actions for evidence and compliance.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Data Integrity: Snapshots and Audit Trails\n\n### State Change Recording and Version History\n- WHEN any entity (order, product, review, user status, coupon, payout, attachment) changes state or content, THE system SHALL capture a complete, versioned, immutable snapshot including actor, timestamp, data before/after, and business rationale.\n- THE system SHALL maintain exhaustive change/audit history per entity for the longer of minimum legal, regulatory, or self-imposed business policy duration (not less than 2 years unless longer required).\n- WHERE admin-initiated edits or rollbacks occur, THE system SHALL log the full before/after diff, actor, and reason, and restrict further changes until secondary approval if required by workflow.\n- IF external data (logistics, payment, settlement, evidence) drives update, THEN THE system SHALL record input provenance, correlation keys, and trace external update to business object.\n\n### Traceability and Tamper Evidence\n- THE system SHALL provide fine-grained traceability for all business-impacting operations, enabling complete reconstruction of entity lifecycles, legal evidence, and compliance monitoring on request from authorized roles.\n- IF tampering, unauthorized manipulation, or out-of-sequence changes are detected in audit logs, THEN THE system SHALL automatically alert risk and compliance admins, lock impacted entities, escalate incident, and begin policy-driven investigation or remediation.\n\n### Audit Trail Data Output and Legal Hold\n- WHEN authorized administrators request audit log output for any entity, timespan, or event, THE system SHALL generate/export a complete record, apply role-based data redaction for protected user fields, and log all access for compliance review.\n- WHERE a legal/administrative hold or dispute is declared, THE system SHALL prohibit destruction, overwriting, or anonymization until event is cleared/released as per legal or contractual rules.\n- WHEN retention windows expire and no legal hold exists, THE system SHALL purge or archive data per data destruction and privacy policy, capturing process evidence in audit trail.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Coupon, Order, and Inventory Policies\n\n### Coupon and Discount Issuance, Management, and Redemption\n- WHEN a coupon or discount is created by eligible user (administrator, seller), THE system SHALL validate configured rules: role eligibility, validity term, application scope, redemption limits, stacking policy, and required business record linkage.\n- WHEN issued, each coupon SHALL be individually tracked by serial, unique code, and redemptions per user/coupon, enforcing per-policy maximums and usage status.\n- IF a coupon is redeemed outside eligibility window, by unauthorized actor, or in an unsupported context (wrong product, user group, date), THEN THE system SHALL block redemption, log the event with code/cause, and present explicit guidance to user.\n- WHERE coupon stacking or combination with other discounts is specified (allowed or forbidden), THE system SHALL enforce the stacking/combination rule at order calculation every time and record which rules applied.\n\n### Inventory Updates and Consistency\n- WHEN an order is created or canceled, THE system SHALL atomically update related inventory balances, prevent negative inventory, and log the before/after count, responsible user, and reason for adjustment.\n- IF an inventory discrepancy is detected (manual audit, sync, external integration), THEN THE system SHALL block order placement or fulfillment for affected SKUs, flag the product and correlated orders as pending review, and notify sellers and administrators.\n- WHERE inventory is distributed among sellers, channels, or physical warehouses, THE system SHALL track each location, prevent aggregate/item-level oversell, and report low-stock thresholds for reordering or market actions.\n\n### Order and Payment Finalization\n- WHERE payment completion is required before accepting an order, THE system SHALL enforce no advancement of order state/status (e.g., to 'confirmed' or 'in fulfillment') prior to successful payment confirmation.\n- IF payment fails (rejection, timeout, expiry, fraud hold), THEN THE system SHALL cancel the pending order, restore all held inventory, release coupon usage/discounts back to eligible state, and inform all parties (customer, seller, admin) with actionable status and next steps.\n- WHEN refunds, reversals, or chargebacks occur, THE system SHALL update order/coupon/inventory records in real-time for absolute consistency and complete audit trail.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Refund, Cancellation, and Return Policies\n\n### Order Cancellation\n- WHEN a customer requests cancellation, THE system SHALL allow only if order status is eligible (pre-shipment, no hand-off to carrier), and require a user-provided reason with timestamped record.\n- IF cancellation eligibility is not met (already shipped/delivered, fulfillment in progress), THEN THE system SHALL block the request and provide business-specific rationale and escalation options (refund, after-service, support).\n- WHERE a seller initiates post-shipping cancellation against policy, THE system SHALL log the breach, record cause, and trigger compensatory workflows (e.g., refund, penalty, customer notification), as in [Performance, Error Handling, and Usability](./11-performance-error-handling-and-usability.md).\n\n### Refund Processing\n- WHEN a refund is requested (customer-initiated or after return/AS), THE system SHALL validate refund eligibility based on payment success, good/item received confirmation, product return (with condition/document evidence if required), and within policy-defined time frame.\n- IF a refund is ineligible or documentation is missing/invalid, THEN THE system SHALL deny request, return clear rationale, and record attempt for escalation.\n- WHEN a refund is approved, THE system SHALL calculate amount strictly according to total paid, deducting any unrefundable charges (shipping, coupon, event), referencing all applicable discounts as defined in [Discounts, Payments and Financial Flows](./06-discounts-payments-and-financial-flows.md), and produce real-time audit trail for each calculation step.\n- IF a refund is delayed past policy deadline, THEN THE system SHALL auto-escalate to administrator for investigation and compensation flow.\n\n### Return Handling, Abuse, and Fraud\n- WHEN a customer requests return, THE system SHALL validate item/order eligibility (product, status, window, policy), require photographic or documentary evidence as stipulated, and log the request with chain-of-custody for the item.\n- WHERE a return is accepted, THE system SHALL update order and inventory status, initiate the corresponding refund calculation, and log all events chronologically for compliance and audit.\n- IF repetitive, abusive, or fraudulent return/refund activity is detected (over-persistent attempts, mismatched evidence, policy gamification), THEN THE system SHALL flag the account, restrict further returns temporarily, and escalate to administrators for final determination.\n- WHEN return/refund is denied, THE system SHALL detail denial reason, log event, and allow customer to request appeal or escalation to support per policy.\n\n---\n\n## 6.

Introduction & Purpose\nAll requirements pertaining to the integration of external systems, extensibility of core functionality, and future readiness for scalable modularization within the shoppingMallAi backend are detailed here. Integrations include, but are not limited to, authentication services, payment gateways, logistics providers, analytics partners, affiliate and SSO connections, and pluggable business logic modules. Modular extensibility ensures shoppingMallAi can adopt new capabilities, partners, and markets with minimal disruption. Each process is governed by clear, enforceable business logic, is described in EARS format, and is supported by actionable rules to allow backend teams to build, extend, and maintain a robust platform ecosystem.\n\n## 2. External Service Authentication\n### Overview\nshoppingMallAi requires unified, secure, and standardized authentication across third-party platforms while preserving platform control, traceability, and security for all user roles.\n\n### Supported Flows\n- Social login for customers (e.g., Google, Facebook, Apple)\n- Seller partner SSO (external merchant/affiliate portals)\n- Organization/intranet SSO for administrators (IDP-based)\n- Fallback internal authentication (email/password)\n\n### EARS Requirements\n- WHEN a customer uses social login, THE system SHALL redirect to the external provider and, upon success, SHALL create or link a customer profile with all necessary attributes and eligibility assignments.\n- WHEN a seller logs in via affiliate SSO, THE system SHALL verify identity, permission scope, and assign merchant role, restricting actions according to platform policy.\n- WHEN an administrator signs in using org SSO, THE system SHALL require multi-factor authentication and log all access events.\n- IF any third-party authentication fails, THEN THE system SHALL deny platform access, display a precise error message, and log the technical and business reason.\n- WHERE required by business policy, THE system SHALL allow fallback to email/password only for roles and flows specifically authorized.\n- WHEN a third-party auth provider is added, updated, or deprecated, THE system SHALL record changes, audit assignment changes, and notify relevant roles of impact.\n\n### Business Rules & Policy\n- All external identity providers integrated with shoppingMallAi must pass a compliance review regarding data sovereignty, consent, session lifecycle, and audit data availability.\n- Each authentication flow must enforce the session duration, refresh, and token structure described in [User Roles & Authentication Requirements](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md).\n- Role and permission mappings from external IDP must not grant privileges outside the defined permission matrix.\n- Authentication failures (invalid token, revoked session) SHALL trigger multi-level alerts (user, administrator, audit logger) and require manual override only by administrators.\n- Policy and workflow for introducing, updating, or removing providers, including admin review and roll-back.\n\n## 3. Payment Gateway Integration\n### Overview\nshoppingMallAi supports a configurable set of payment gateways (e.g., credit card processors, e-wallets, open banking) for secure, auditable, real-time and offline payment handling. Only fully certified and regulated gateways are permitted.\n\n### EARS Requirements\n- WHEN a customer proceeds to payment, THE system SHALL transfer all order-relevant payment data to the selected gateway, receive and verify transaction results, and update order/payment state atomically.\n- IF the payment is declined, fails, or is aborted by user/system, THEN THE system SHALL roll back provisional changes and immediately explain the error with status code, reason, and possible corrective actions.\n- WHEN more than one payment option is enabled (e.g., e-wallet, credit card, bank transfer), THE system SHALL present all eligible options based on user, region, device, and order context, and record chosen method for analytics.\n- WHEN a payment gateway is delayed (over 10 seconds), THE system SHALL transparently set the payment to pending, inform the user, and re-check at intervals until timeout or resolution.\n- IF payment is flagged for fraud or regulatory review, THEN THE system SHALL block order fulfillment, notify both customer and admin, and document all steps for compliance.\n\n### Business Rules\n- Payment gateway onboarding must follow vendor risk/compliance checklists and contractual approval, subject to platform owner sign-off.\n- Payment tokens and customer card data may never be stored by the platform, except via transparent gateway vaults as required by law.\n- Refunds and chargebacks must use APIs if supported and match the original payment flow in terms of data field mapping, error codes, audit logs, and business workflow.\n- Batch settlement and reconciliation logs must be downloadable/exportable by permitted admin users, using platform permission rules.\n\n### Error Handling\n- WHEN a payment API is unavailable, THE system SHALL offer retry once, then redirect to payment method selection with a detailed cause.\n- IF suspicious payment activity is detected (failed attempts, high volume), THEN THE system SHALL rate-limit further payment attempts for that account/device and require identity verification before resumption, logging all events.\n\n## 4. API/Platform Connectivity\n### Overview\nshoppingMallAi requires robust API-based data exchange and automation with partners, affiliates, logistics, and channel systems, ensuring all interfaces are secure, discoverable, and business-governed.\n\n### EARS Requirements\n- WHEN an external system calls a public API endpoint, THE system SHALL require authentication as defined by platform policy, enforce data contract validation, and respond only with permitted business data.\n- WHERE a new integration exposes user/product/order/fulfillment APIs, THE system SHALL require version identifiers, endpoint documentation, and access monitoring.\n- IF a request fails contract checks or is unauthorized, THEN THE system SHALL block, log, and alert relevant roles, returning compliant business error codes.\n- WHEN new partner systems are onboarded, THE system SHALL provide technical onboarding flows, test sandbox environments, and require acceptance of data governance rules before allowing live traffic.\n\n### Business Rules\n- Only authorized roles may request or grant integration API keys, and all keys must be revoked upon role/account deactivation.\n- REST and webhook push/pull operations are supported for core integrations (orders, product sync, inventory, fulfillment), with optional future support for GraphQL/gRPC as business needs demand.\n- All API response payloads must redact or pseudonymize regulated personal data, as directed by compliance policies.\n- API deprecation must follow a 90-day minimum notification period, including backward support and migration toolkits for affected partners.\n- All API and data exchange endpoints must be discoverable to eligible partners via platform-controlled registry, including documentation, version, and role-based access rights.\n- Detailed business process diagrams for all core API/data exchange flows are maintained in the [API/Platform Connectivity section].\n\n### Supported Protocols & Endpoints (Business Perspective)\n- REST for partner/channel communication and product, order, and inventory updates\n- Webhook/Push for real-time event notifications (order events, delivery, status updates)\n- Optional GraphQL/gRPC for future deep integration layers or high-throughput partners\n- Specific endpoints include: partner inventory allocation, real-time price sync, shipment creation and status, affiliate referral and commission reporting, channel analytics.\n\n## 5. Extensible Modules\n### Overview\nshoppingMallAi supports extensible business logic via pluggable modules, seller or partner-specific customizations, and on-demand provisioning of AI/GPT features (product recommendations, search, analytics), without breaking core flows or compliance monitoring.\n\n### EARS Requirements\n- WHEN a module/provider is registered, THE system SHALL require and validate a manifest describing business scope, data access, and supported integration events (life cycle: registration, activation, update, deactivation, retirement).\n- WHERE a module requests or requires access to elevated privileges (payments, customer data, internal APIs), THE system SHALL require explicit administrator approval and document the business justification.\n- IF a module fails to initialize or causes business errors, THEN THE system SHALL automatically isolate, roll back all mutable changes, log incident, and inform permitted admin users.\n- WHEN a module is updated (version bump, integration of new feature), THE system SHALL run compatibility and permission tests and suspend deployment if any required contract fails.\n- WHERE a partner, AI, or analytics module is deprecated, THE system SHALL retain audit logs for a policy-defined retention period and remove all unneeded integration points.\n\n### Business Rules\n- Only permitted users (sellers and administrators) may request/enable modules or plug-ins for their scope; all global modules require administrator approval.\n- All modules must operate within permission boundaries defined in the module manifest and matching the platform role matrix.\n- Each module's registration/activation/deactivation/retirement state is auditable and reversible by permitted administrators.\n- Module catalogues must expose public and proprietary modules separately, providing business/legal and feature data for each.\n- All module errors, risk signals, and life cycle events must be visible to relevant roles in the admin dashboard, using business-centric event codes, and be available for export as CSV/Excel for compliance audits.\n- Use cases: addition of dynamic pricing logic, external AI for personalization, logistics/shipping provider plug-ins, affiliate commission engines, language translation for new markets.\n\n## 6. Versioning & Backward Compatibility\n### Overview\nAll integration APIs, module interfaces, and data contracts require business-driven versioning and strict compatibility management.\n\n### EARS Requirements\n- WHEN a new version of any business contract, API, or module is released, THE system SHALL notify all affected roles, maintain backward compatibility for a minimum of 12 months, and publish deprecation and migration guidance.\n- IF a breaking change is required and cannot be avoided, THEN THE system SHALL provide a business-led upgrade path, migration toolkit, and support resources at least 90 days before enforcement.\n- WHERE multiple active versions of an integration/module exist, THE system SHALL route partner/customer requests to the requested or eligible version, in compliance with policy.\n- WHEN a version reaches end-of-life, THE system SHALL archive or migrate all data as specified by business rules and inform all impacted parties in advance.\n\n### Business Rules\n- APIs/modules must be tagged and documented in the public/private partner portal, including affected business areas, supported versions, and sunset schedules.\n- All legacy/archived versions must remain accessible for audit/statistics but blocked for new connections or changes.\n- Version conflicts, schema drift, and backward-compatibility disputes must be escalated to a dedicated platform admin, using business rationale and recorded in the operational log.\n\n## 7. Business Scenarios & Use Cases\n\n### Scenario 1: New Logistics Partner API Integration\nWHEN a new logistics company is selected, THE system SHALL require a partnership agreement, register the API, run test order and fulfillment events, and audit compliance and latency before production enabling. Key steps: onboarding, credentials/testing, data mapping, simulation runs, role approval, live launch, ongoing monitoring, and evidence retention.\n\n### Scenario 2: Seller Deploys Custom Analytics Module\nWHEN a seller opts for analytics/personalization plug-in, THE system SHALL validate credentials, assign scope (i.e., only to the seller’s own products), sandbox all data, and restrict API visibility to business objects and actions allowed by role. Feedback loop and error handling must be auditable, reversible, and explainable from a business process perspective.\n\n### Scenario 3: Affiliate Referral and Commission Reporting Integration\nWHEN an affiliate initiates integration, THE system SHALL require business registration, compliance check, map payout logic, enable commission workflow, provide performance portal, and subject all actions to audit and approval. Role-based business rules must govern commission triggers, payment cycles, fraud detection, and access rights.\n\n### Scenario 4: AI-Powered Personalization API Extension\nWHEN an administrator enables a new AI-powered recommendation engine, THE system SHALL require module registration, approval of data access and personalization scope, and provide role-based UI and reporting. All model learning data, audit events, and configuration changes must be accessible to administrators and auditable for compliance.\n\n### Scenario 5: Emergency Provider Deactivation and Failover\nIF a payment gateway or logistics integration is compromised (security, business, legal), THEN THE system SHALL immediately isolate the provider, queue pending transactions, reroute eligible traffic to alternative channels, and notify all users/administrators. Allowed failover actions and user/business notification flows must be clearly documented.\n\n## 8. Business Rules, Performance & Error Handling\n\n### Integration-Specific Business Policy\n- All integration onboarding, offboarding, and role mapping processes must be governed by clear business workflows, including dynamic approval, version compatibility, policy update triggers, and multi-role notifications.\n- Integrations can be initiated, reviewed, modified, and withdrawn only by roles and users with explicit platform rights, as described in the permissions matrix below. Unauthorized activity leads to immediate suspension and alert escalation.\n- All real-time event integrations (e.g., payments, AI recommendations) must meet end-user-perceived latency requirements (see Performance & SLAs below).\n- Administrative dashboards must provide filtering, export, and bulk-action tools for integration management, error review, and compliance documentation.\n- Full auditability and traceability is required for all integration-related business and error events. Data and event logs must be retained per legal/business policy.\n\n### Performance & SLAs (EARS Format)\n- WHEN any authentication, payment, or mission-critical integration is invoked, THE system SHALL complete user-facing business operations (auth, payment confirmation, event notification) within 3 seconds for 95% of interactions under normal load.\n- WHEN a batch integration process (nightly sync, analytics update) is triggered, THE system SHALL guarantee completion within defined schedule, notify all dependent users of window and exceptions, and escalate on failure.\n- WHEN an error threshold (rate/volume) is crossed for any integration, THE system SHALL immediately log the event, flag affected roles, and trigger a support team notification and require periodic status updates until resolved.\n\n### Error & Exception Handling (EARS Format)\n- IF a partner or platform integration action (API, payment, module event) fails for any business reason, THEN THE system SHALL provide precise user/admin feedback, log the event with business context, and offer remediation or failover workflow.\n- IF an integration returns a non-business-compliant or unrecognized status, THEN THE system SHALL alert affected roles and administrators, flag as “pending manual review”, and record the complete business, technical, and partner-specific details.\n- IF a platform administrator explicitly revokes an integration/module for compliance or emergency, THEN THE system SHALL terminate all active session tokens, queue pending transactions, inform all users, and escalate the event with required report generation and evidence collection.\n- IF integration-induced failures impact user experience (delayed payments, data sync issues), THEN THE system SHALL preserve all pending actions, retry according to policy, and inform all affected users with guidance on next step and estimated recovery windows.\n\n## 9.

It is designed to provide stakeholders—including backend developers and business operators—with actionable visualizations, role matrices, and summary aids that supplement core requirement documents. Every table and diagram is carefully explained to ensure clarity of backend permissions, business workflows, and operational boundaries.\n\n## 1. Reference Tables & Matrices\n\n### 1.1 User Roles and Permissions Matrix\n\nThe matrix below clarifies which core actions each role can perform. All permissions correspond to the business workflows described in the requirements documents. Where a permission is listed as \"✅\" for a role, the role may perform the full business process; otherwise, access is denied and the system enforces this by returning a clear, actionable error (see EARS error rules in main requirements).\n\n| Action/Feature                                   | Customer | Seller | Administrator |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|---------------|\n| Register account                                 | ✅       | ✅    | ❌            |\n| Browse/search products                           | ✅       | ✅    | ✅            |\n| Purchase products                                | ✅       | ❌    | ✅            |\n| Manage personal orders and returns               | ✅       | ❌    | ✅            |\n| Write product reviews/inquiries                  | ✅       | ❌    | ✅            |\n| Issue/manage products & listings                 | ❌       | ✅    | ✅            |\n| Manage incoming orders on own listings           | ❌       | ✅    | ✅            |\n| Track sales performance, coupons, analytics      | ❌       | ✅    | ✅            |\n| Moderate content (reviews, inquiries, listings)  | ❌       | ❌    | ✅            |\n| Access business analytics dashboard              | ❌       | ✅    | ✅            |\n| Verify and approve seller onboarding             | ❌       | ❌    | ✅            |\n| Manage user/seller accounts                      | ❌       | ❌    | ✅            |\n| Change platform/system settings                  | ❌       | ❌    | ✅            |\n\n**Permission Edge Cases and Business Rules:**\n- IF a user (of any role) attempts an action that is not permitted (e.g., a customer tries to manage product listings), THEN THE system SHALL reject the action and provide a business reason in the error response.\n- IF a seller attempts to access another seller's data, THEN THE system SHALL block access even when the action would otherwise be allowed for \"seller\" on their own listings.\n- WHEN administrators act, they may override or audit other roles but must comply with logged business audit trails for any such intervention.\n- Where permissions are limited to \"own data\" (e.g., 'Manage incoming orders on own listings'), enforce ownership at all validation stages.\n\n### 1.2 Order Lifecycle States Matrix\n\nThis matrix outlines each business-recognized order state and clarifies the transitions and stakeholder expectations at every point in the purchase lifecycle. State transitions correspond to the system processes described in the order management requirements.\n\n| Order State            | Description                                                    |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| CART                  | Order items reside in cart and can be updated/removed           |\n| PENDING_PAYMENT       | Order placed, awaiting payment                                  |\n| PAID                  | Payment received successfully                                   |\n| PROCESSING            | Seller preparing order for shipment                             |\n| SHIPPED               | Order dispatched, tracking available                            |\n| DELIVERED             | Customer receives order                                         |\n| CANCELED              | Order canceled by user, seller, or admin                        |\n| RETURN_REQUESTED      | Customer requested return/refund                                |\n| RETURNED              | Order returned, refund in process                              |\n| COMPLETED             | Order lifecycle finished, eligible for review                   |\n\n**State Transition Notes:**\n- WHEN a state transition fails validation or business logic (e.g., marking as \"PAID\" without valid payment), THEN THE system SHALL refuse the state change and notify all affected stakeholders with actionable reasons.\n- WHERE multiple sellers and split orders are involved, the parent order state reflects the aggregate state, while sub-orders track individual flows.\n- IF an order is canceled after shipment, return and refund rules trigger automatically as per business logic in primary requirements.\n\n### 1.3 Discount and Coupon Types Table\n\nDiscounts and coupon incentives form part of the business’s pricing, sales, and marketing strategies. The table clarifies scope, typical issuers, and business-side usage restrictions. All coupon/discount application follows rule-based validation (EARS in requirements document).\n\n| Coupon/Discount Type       | Applicable Scope           | Issuer      | Usage Restrictions         |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|\n| Product Coupon            | Individual product         | Seller      | Single product only        |\n| Cart Coupon               | Entire cart                | Seller/Admin| Min. purchase threshold    |\n| Percent Discount          | Product/order/cart         | Seller/Admin| Often capped, by config    |\n| Shipping Coupon           | Shipping fees              | Seller/Admin| May have region limits     |\n| Loyalty Points/Mileage    | Platform-wide              | System      | Limited by balance         |\n| Event/Special             | Event/seasonal products    | Seller/Admin| Valid only for event term  |\n\n**Business Clarification and Edge Cases:**\n- IF a coupon is submitted outside its valid window or context, THEN THE system SHALL reject redemption and specify the relevant EARS error (e.g., COUPON_EXPIRED, INELIGIBLE_ORDER).\n- WHEN a user tries to combine non-stackable discounts, THE system SHALL validate stacking constraints before order finalization.\n- Each coupon/discount must be auditable and traceable to the issuing party and must comply with global and per-user redemption ceilings.\n\n### 1.4 File Attachment Type Table\n\nThe business context of each file type is defined below, indicating responsible roles and mandatory business validations. File handling policies are elaborated in the [Attachment and File Management Requirements](./09-attachment-and-file-management.md).\n\n| Attachment Context        | File Type Examples          | Key Rules                                   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Product Listing         | JPG, PNG                    | Max size per image, preview generation      |\n| Review/Inquiry          | PNG, JPG, PDF               | Evidence uploads must be moderated          |\n| Identity Verification   | PDF, JPG                    | Restricted access, secure storage required  |\n| Seller Business Docs    | PDF, JPG                    | Only for administrators, audit trails kept  |\n\n**File Management & Compliance Notes:**\n- IF a file is uploaded with the wrong format or outside configured limits, THEN THE system SHALL flag the action, inform the uploader, and require immediate correction.\n- WHERE files are business-critical (e.g., seller onboarding), THE system SHALL require successful upload before process completion.\n- Ownership, access control, and retention are strictly governed—see [Attachment and File Management Requirements](./09-attachment-and-file-management.md) for process EARS.\n\n## 2. Business Flow Diagrams\n\nThe diagrams in this section visualize mission-critical business processes. Each flow is fully compliant with strict Mermaid syntax—ALL labels use double quotes, there are no spaces outside brackets and quotes, and no arrows use invalid notations. Each is accompanied by business logic commentary clarifying workflow expectations for backend developers.\n\n### 2.1 User Registration and Authentication Flow\n\nNew user creation and entry into the system must validate identity, ensure data completeness, and support confirmation workflows for compliance. Business rules enforce verification at every decision point.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"User Auth Flow\"\n    A[\"User Starts Registration\"] --> B[\"Input Email/Password/Social Account\"]\n    B --> C[\"System Validates Input\"]\n    C --> D{\"Valid?\"}\n    D -->|\"Yes\"| E[\"Account Creation\"]\n    D -->|\"No\"| F[\"Show Error Message\"]\n    E --> G[\"Send Verification Email/SMS\"]\n    G --> H{\"User Confirms?\"}\n    H -->|\"Yes\"| I[\"Complete Registration\"]\n    H -->|\"No\"| J[\"Await User Action\"]\n    I --> K[\"Login Enabled\"]\n  end\n```\n\nWHEN required registration data is incomplete or fails validation, THE system SHALL block account creation and return top-level error details with guidance for correction. All successful registrations trigger verification and status controls before login is enabled, maintaining auditability throughout the process.\n\n### 2.2 Order and Payment Processing Flow\n\nOrder creation and payment flows are pivotal to business health, combining customer input, system validations, payment handling, and post-purchase activities. Parallel processes for fulfillment and customer notification are embedded.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Order/Payment Process\"\n    AA[\"User Adds Item to Cart\"] --> AB[\"Review Cart\"]\n    AB --> AC[\"Proceed to Checkout\"]\n    AC --> AD[\"Input Shipping & Payment\"]\n    AD --> AE[\"System Validates Details\"]\n    AE --> AF{\"Valid?\"}\n    AF -->|\"Yes\"| AG[\"Attempt Payment\"]\n    AF -->|\"No\"| AH[\"Show Input Error\"]\n    AG --> AI{\"Payment Success?\"}\n    AI -->|\"Yes\"| AJ[\"Confirm Order, Issue Invoice\"]\n    AI -->|\"No\"| AK[\"Show Payment Error\"]\n    AJ --> AL[\"Notify Seller\"]\n    AL --> AM[\"Order Processing by Seller\"]\n    AM --> AN[\"Ship Item\"]\n    AN --> AO[\"Track/Update Order Status\"]\n    AO --> AP[\"Delivery Complete\"]\n    AP --> AQ[\"Post-Purchase: Review, Return Option\"]\n  end\n```\n\nWHEN payment fails or order validation triggers a business logic error, THE system SHALL log the failure, return actionable feedback, and ensure atomic state handling for cart, order, and payment data. Successful payment always leads to downstream fulfillment and customer notification; any substantial delays or exceptions must be visible at each business step.\n\n### 2.3 Product Catalog Workflow\n\nCatalog management enables sellers to maintain their digital storefronts while ensuring quality and compliance through administrator review. State transitions ensure only valid, approved products reach customers.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Catalog Management\"\n    BA[\"Seller Logs In\"] --> BB[\"List New Product or Edit Existing\"]\n    BB --> BC[\"Input Product Details/Images\"]\n    BC --> BD[\"Select Category/Options\"]\n    BD --> BE[\"System Validates Data\"]\n    BE --> BF{\"Approved by Admin?\"}\n    BF -->|\"Yes\"| BG[\"Product Published\"]\n    BF -->|\"No\"| BH[\"Admin Feedback to Seller\"]\n    BH --> BB\n    BG --> BI[\"Visible to Shoppers\"]\n  end\n```\n\nProduct submissions that fail business or data validation, or are denied by admins, are rerouted for re-edit, with explicit business feedback given for correction and resubmission. Products become eligible for public display only after successful multi-stage verification and compliance review. Every catalog transaction is fully audited, with change histories accessible for dispute or legal checks.\n\n### 2.4 Community Review and Inquiry Workflow\n\nCustomer-generated content is a vital business asset, but must balance openness and moderation to protect platform integrity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  subgraph \"Review/Inquiry Flow\"\n    CA[\"Customer Purchases Product\"] --> CB[\"Eligible for Review/Inquiry\"]\n    CB --> CC[\"Submit Review or Inquiry\"]\n    CC --> CD[\"System Moderates Content\"]\n    CD --> CE{\"Compliant?\"}\n    CE -->|\"Yes\"| CF[\"Publish to Product Page\"]\n    CE -->|\"No\"| CG[\"Flag/Rework Submission\"]\n    CG --> CC\n  end\n```\n\nWHEN user submissions breach business rules (inappropriate content, non-purchase review attempts, suspicious attachments), THE system SHALL route cases for moderation, loop back for user correction, or enforce denial and escalation to administrators according to the business escalation chain. All actions and status changes are logged and reviewable for compliance.\n\n## 3. Supplementary Materials\n\n### 3.1 Glossary Reference\n\nDetailed terminology—including all user and system role definitions, business logic concepts, and key process flows—is provided in the [Platform Glossary](./13-glossary.md). WHEN a term is not understood or causes contest, THE system SHALL reference the glossary to standardize process language across all business and technical stakeholders.\n\n### 3.2 Key Success Metrics Table\n\nKey performance indicators express critical business outcomes and operational health. Developers and operators must use these metrics to guide design and respond to business change.\n\n| KPI Name              | Description                                         | Typical Target         | Business Impact                                     |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Monthly Active Users  | Unique users engaged monthly                        | 10,000+               | Measures adoption and engagement rate               |\n| Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) | Total value of goods sold through platform    | $X million/month      | Indicates revenue throughput and marketplace scale  |\n| Conversion Rate       | % of visitors making purchases                      | >2%                   | Assesses effectiveness of sales funnel              |\n| Repeat Purchase Rate  | % of orders from repeat buyers                      | >30%                  | Tracks customer loyalty & business retention        |\n| Average Resolution Time| Avg. time to handle inquiries/issues                | <24h                  | Indicates support responsiveness and satisfaction   |\n| Seller Onboarding Speed| Avg. time to full seller live status                | <5 days               | Reflects seller-facing business efficiency          |\n\nWHEN performance or engagement metrics fall below target thresholds, THE business SHALL require root cause analysis and business-side process review, triggering improvements or optimizations in platform workflows as needed.\n\n### 3.3 Additional Supplementary Notes\n\n- WHEN backend business processes evolve to include new features, roles, or compliance requirements, THE appendix SHALL be updated to reflect any new matrices, flows, or KPIs relevant to ongoing operation.\n- All reference documents are cross-linked using clear, descriptive text for seamless navigation and business alignment.\n- For in-depth role and permission requirements: see [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md)\n- For transaction flows and state logic: see [Order and Cart Management Requirements](./05-order-and-cart-management.md)\n- For product, catalog, and attachment policies: see [Product and Catalog Management Requirements](./04-product-and-catalog-management.md) and [Attachment and File Management Requirements](./09-attachment-and-file-management.md)\n\n---\n\nEvery visual, matrix, and table in this appendix is crafted to support backend platform consistency, business scalability, compliance, and operational clarity. WHEN questions of workflow, permissions, or performance arise, backend developers SHALL reference these appendices to drive high-confidence, policy-aligned implementation. No implementation source code or technical schema is included by design—business requirements and operational clarity are the sole focus throughout."}],"created_at":"2025-08-15T05:10:46.748Z","completed_at":"2025-08-15T05:16:21.432Z","step":0}]
