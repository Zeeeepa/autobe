Core Business Rules\n- THE system SHALL enforce transactional integrity for all order-related operations.\n- WHEN a seller updates product information, THE system SHALL validate for prohibited content and regional restrictions.\n- WHEN promotions or loyalty campaigns are launched, THE system SHALL validate user eligibility and compliance with jurisdictional rules.\n- IF a customer account is flagged for suspicious activity, THEN THE system SHALL initiate enhanced authentication and limit transactional abilities until resolution.\n- WHERE AI/ML personalization is used, THE system SHALL provide opt-out mechanisms, complying with relevant privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n\n## 3. Legal & Regulatory Compliance\n- THE system SHALL log all roles' access to sensitive customer or transactional data for auditability (GDPR Article 30).\n- WHEN receiving or processing personally identifiable information (PII), THE system SHALL encrypt data at rest and in transit.\n- IF there is user data deletion or account closure, THEN THE system SHALL enforce proper data erasure in alignment with applicable retention policies.\n- THE system SHALL regularly review and update compliance checklists for consumer protection and e-commerce law (local and international).\n\n## 4. AI/ML Features & Governance\n- WHEN deploying new AI/ML models, THE system SHALL retain explainability information about inference decisions impacting users.\n- THE system SHALL document and monitor potential bias in AI personalization or recommendations, enabling transparent review.\n- IF an AI-driven promotion or recommendation engine is activated, THEN THE system SHALL monitor for unfair targeting or exclusion.\n- THE system SHALL support user access to explanations regarding automated decision-making processes affecting order prioritization.\n\n## 5. Advanced Analytics\n- WHERE advanced analytics dashboards are accessible, THE system SHALL anonymize all individual user data and restrict sensitive attribute exposure.\n- THE system SHALL enable granular audit trails for all analytics queries executed by admins or sellers.\n- WHILE exporting analytics datasets, THE system SHALL enforce mandatory masking of PII and critical business data.\n\n## 6. Accessibility & Inclusive Design\n- THE system SHALL comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards across all user-facing interfaces.\n- WHEN new features are released, THE system SHALL validate accessibility using both automated tools and manual review.\n- THE system SHALL provide alternative text on all media and support screen reader compatibility for primary workflows.\n\n## 7. Overarching Constraints\n- THE system SHALL allow only authorized roles to perform actions within their assigned permission scope.\n- WHEN system configurations are modified, THE system SHALL create immutable logs for compliance review.\n- IF there is a detected deviation from business rules, THEN THE system SHALL alert admins for enforcement action.\n\n---\n\nFeedback and further compliance recommendations are encouraged to ensure continued alignment with evolving business, legal, and technology standards."},"created_at":"2025-08-04T10:00:50.569Z","completed_at":"2025-08-04T10:00:50.569Z","step":0}]
