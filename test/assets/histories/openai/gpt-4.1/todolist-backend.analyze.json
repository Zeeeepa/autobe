User Role Overview\n\n### 1.1 Role Definition: User\n- **Role name:** user\n- **Description:** A registered individual who can manage their own todo items, including creating, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks via the API.\n\n### 1.2 Role Responsibilities and Scope\n- Users are responsible for the security of their credentials and safeguarding access to their own todo data.\n- Users may only access, view, modify, delete, or restore todo items that are owned by their own account.\n- Cross-user data access and manipulation are strictly prohibited for all users. No user can view, list, or interact with another user’s todo items, regardless of circumstance.\n- The user role exists solely to enable self-service management of personal todos including creation, viewing, editing, marking as complete/incomplete, soft deletion, restoration within the permitted period, and permanent removal per business rules.\n- Users may not escalate permissions, assign roles, or alter system settings; users have no access to administrative or moderation functions.\n\n### 1.3 Illustrative User Examples\n- A user registers with an email and password, receives a verification link, verifies the email, and manages their todo list independently. At no point can they see or edit other users’ tasks.\n- WHEN a user initiates a RESTORE operation on a task, THE system SHALL check the task’s ownership and time-based eligibility before processing the restore.\n- IF a user account is deleted, THEN all tasks belonging to that user SHALL be subject to permanent deletion or retention per [Privacy and Data Protection Requirements](./09-privacy-and-data-protection.md).\n\n## 2.

Authentication Requirements\n\n### 3.1 Registration\n- THE todoList system SHALL permit a new user to register using a unique valid email address and password that conforms to business rule requirements.\n- WHEN a user registers with an already registered email address, THEN THE system SHALL display an error indicating the email is already in use.\n- WHEN a user successfully submits registration data, THE system SHALL issue an email verification required event and block all account access until email is verified.\n- THE todoList system SHALL only allow single verified account registration per unique email address.\n\n### 3.2 Email Verification\n- THE todoList system SHALL send a unique verification link to the provided email immediately upon successful registration.\n- WHEN a user verifies their email via the link, THE system SHALL enable full access to account features.\n- IF a user attempts to log in before verifying their email, THEN THE system SHALL deny authentication and present a message instructing the user to verify their email first.\n- WHEN a verification link is expired or invalid, THE system SHALL provide a clear error response and an option to request a new link.\n\n### 3.3 Login\n- THE todoList system SHALL permit users to log in using their email and password only after successful verification.\n- WHEN a user enters valid credentials, THE system SHALL establish an authenticated session, issue tokens as specified below, and grant access to the user's private todo list.\n- IF a user enters invalid credentials, THEN THE system SHALL deny login and inform the user that the provided information is incorrect.\n- IF a user account is locked, disabled, deleted, or otherwise invalid, THEN THE system SHALL deny login and inform the user of the business-appropriate reason (without leaking further details).\n- IF, from the same IP address, 5 or more consecutive failed login attempts occur within a 5 minute window, THEN THE system SHALL temporarily block login attempts from that IP for 10 minutes, and inform the user of the lockout.\n- THE todoList system SHALL log all failed authentication attempts for monitoring and abuse prevention.\n\n### 3.4 Password Reset and Recovery\n- WHEN a user requests password reset, THE todoList system SHALL send a single-use, time-limited password reset link to the registered email if it exists in the system.\n- WHEN a valid reset link is used, THE system SHALL allow the user to set a new password meeting the current password complexity requirements, and SHALL immediately invalidate all prior access and refresh tokens.\n- IF a reset link is expired, invalid, or previously used, THEN THE system SHALL deny password reset and present a clear business error message.\n- THE todoList system SHALL enforce a minimum password complexity: at least 8 characters, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character; no spaces at start or end; and shall block use of passwords on a banned/compromised list.\n- IF a new password fails validation, THEN THE system SHALL reject the reset attempt and enumerate specific reasons (e.g., insufficient length, lacks required character types).\n\n### 3.5 Changing Password\n- THE todoList system SHALL allow users to change their password at any time after authentication.\n- WHEN a user changes their password, THE system SHALL require entry of the current password as verification.\n- THE new password SHALL comply with all complexity and business rule requirements. WHEN the password change is completed, all prior sessions and tokens SHALL be invalidated.\n\n### 3.6 Session Timeout and Automatic Logoff\n- WHILE a user is inactive for a period determined by business rules (default: 2 hours), THE system SHALL automatically log out the user and invalidate session tokens.\n- WHEN an access token expires (see section 4), users must re-authenticate or use a valid refresh token for session renewal, per business rules.\n\n## 4. Session and Token Management\n\n### 4.1 Token-Based Authentication (JWT)\n- THE todoList system SHALL use JWT (JSON Web Token) for both access and refresh token strategies.\n- WHEN a user logs in successfully, THE system SHALL issue an access token (JWT) valid for 20 minutes and a refresh token (JWT) valid for 14 days.\n- THE access token SHALL include in its payload: userId (unique account identifier), role (string, \"user\"), and a permissions array as specified in the current permissions matrix.\n- THE refresh token SHALL be securely tied to the issuing user and device/session context.\n- THE JWT secret key SHALL be securely managed by the server, never exposed to clients, and rotated per security best practices and audit policy.\n\n### 4.2 Token Storage\n- THE todoList system SHALL store tokens in a secure, HTTP-only cookie by default. WHERE explicit business rules permit, localStorage MAY be used with clear documentation of associated risks and opt-in requirements.\n\n### 4.3 Token Expiry and Renewal\n- WHEN an access token expires, IF a valid refresh token exists, THEN THE todoList system SHALL issue a new access token, and extend session validity accordingly.\n- WHEN a refresh token is expired, invalid, or revoked, THEN THE todoList system SHALL require explicit re-authentication.\n- IF a user logs out, THEN THE todoList system SHALL immediately invalidate all access and refresh tokens for the current device/session, ensuring no further business operations are permitted until re-authentication.\n\n### 4.4 Token Revocation and Threat Response\n- WHEN suspicious or malicious activity is detected (e.g., concurrent logins from geographically distant locations, known credential leakage), THE system SHALL revoke all active tokens for the affected user and provide notice by email.\n- WHEN a user changes their password, THE system SHALL invalidate all outstanding access and refresh tokens and require re-login for every device.\n- THE todoList system SHALL maintain an audit log of all token issuances, renewals, and revocations for compliance and business monitoring.\n\n### 4.5 Example Token Payload Structure (Business View)\n| Property     | Example Value                          |\n|--------------|----------------------------------------|\n| userId       | \"a7f6b872-c2b1-4f33-9d2e-7bba4396e7c7\" |\n| role         | \"user\"                                 |\n| permissions  | [ \"createTodo\", \"editTodo\", \"deleteTodo\", \"viewOwnTodos\", \"restoreTodo\" ] |\n| issuedAt     | \"2025-08-14T13:15:13Z\"                |\n| expiresAt    | \"2025-08-14T13:35:13Z\"                |\n\n### 4.6 Session Expiration and Forced Logout\n- WHEN a device, session, or user’s tokens are invalidated due to business rules or security incident, THE system SHALL immediately block all subsequent API interactions until re-authentication occurs.\n- THE todoList system SHALL provide a business-compliant error response and actionable remediation steps to users attempting to use expired or revoked tokens (see [Error Handling and Exception Scenarios](./08-error-handling-and-exception-scenarios.md)).\n\n## 5. Role Limitations and Restrictions\n\n### 5.1 General Constraints\n- THE \"user\" role has no administrative, moderation, audit, or cross-user privileges under any circumstances.\n- IF a user attempts an operation on another user’s todo item, THEN THE system SHALL deny the operation, return a business error explaining the violation (“You may only modify your own todos”), and log the attempt for audit and abuse prevention.\n- IF a user attempts to access any role, permission assignment, system configuration, or business function not listed as permitted in the matrix above, THEN THE system SHALL return a forbidden error and take no further action.\n- THE todoList system SHALL never allow a user to view, modify, or manage other users’ authentication or account data.\n- THE todoList system SHALL never allow bypassing email verification, registration, or authentication steps by business or technical flaw.\n- All forbidden behaviors SHALL result in business-defined error handling—see [Error Handling and Exception Scenarios](./08-error-handling-and-exception-scenarios.md) for patterns.\n\n### 5.2 Failure and Edge Case Handling\n- IF a user’s session expires during an active operation, THEN THE todoList system SHALL inform the user and require re-authentication before any operation is processed.\n- IF a user requests restoration of a deleted task beyond the allowable window, THEN THE todoList system SHALL deny the restoration and return an error message (“This task can no longer be recovered”).\n- WHEN a user repeatedly attempts forbidden operations (more than 10 violations in a 24-hour period), THE system SHALL flag the account for review and potentially restrict access per [Business Rules and Validation](./06-business-rules-and-validation.md).\n- WHERE system-level errors or outages prevent authentication or access, THE todoList system SHALL transparently communicate service-wide issues, escalate alerts to operators, and maintain business-compliant messaging for end users.\n\n### 5.3 Business Rule Compliance\n- THE todoList system SHALL align all user role permissions, authentication, and token policies as defined here and in [Functional Requirements Documentation](./03-functional-requirements.md), [Business Rules and Validation](./06-business-rules-and-validation.md), [Error Handling and Exception Scenarios](./08-error-handling-and-exception-scenarios.md), and [Privacy and Data Protection](./09-privacy-and-data-protection.md).\n- All developer implementation decisions for technical architecture, database schemas, and API design are strictly separated from the business requirements enumerated here.\n\n## References to Other Documents\n\n- For a detailed specification of todo item operations: [Functional Requirements Documentation](./03-functional-requirements.md)\n- For business rules and data consistency requirements: [Business Rules and Validation](./06-business-rules-and-validation.md)\n- For error messaging and handling flows: [Error Handling and Exception Scenarios](./08-error-handling-and-exception-scenarios.md)\n- For privacy and user data protections: [Privacy and Data Protection Requirements](./09-privacy-and-data-protection.md)\n"},{"reason":"To comprehensively describe all functional requirements and business rules for managing todo items using natural language in EARS format.","filename":"03-functional-requirements.md","documentType":"requirement","outline":["Core Features Overview","Task Creation Requirements","Task Management Workflow","Task Editing and Completion","Deletion and Restoration Rules","Edge Cases"],"audience":"development team","detailLevel":"detailed specification","content":"# Functional Requirements for TodoList Application\n\n## 1.

Task Creation Requirements\n\n### Requirements\n- THE system SHALL allow authenticated users to create new todo tasks.\n- WHEN a user creates a new todo, THE system SHALL require the following fields: task title (string, min 1 character, max 128), and optionally, a description (string, max 1000 characters).\n- THE system SHALL automatically record the creation timestamp for each new task in UTC ISO 8601 format.\n- WHEN a user submits a task with empty or invalid fields, THEN THE system SHALL reject the request and provide a descriptive error message, referencing the violated rule.\n- WHEN a user submits a new task with a duplicate title (case-insensitive, whitespace ignored) within their own active task list, THEN THE system SHALL reject the request with a 'duplicate title' error.\n- THE system SHALL limit task creation rate to 100 per user per hour to prevent abuse.\n- THE system SHALL validate that the title has no leading or trailing whitespace and description contains no prohibited characters (e.g., control, markup, or code injection sequences).\n- WHEN a user attempts to create a task with unsupported characters in the title/description, THEN THE system SHALL reject the request and provide a warning detailing the character and location.\n- THE system SHALL assign a unique identifier to each task upon creation to enable unambiguous task management and referencing.\n\n### Examples\n| Field         | Requirement                                |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Title         | Required, 1-128 chars, trimmed, no control chars |\n| Description   | Optional, up to 1000 chars, validated          |\n| Status        | Default: 'pending' (not completed)             |\n| Created At    | Auto-generated, UTC ISO 8601                   |\n| Task ID       | Auto-generated, unique per user                |\n\n## 3. Task Management Workflow\n\n### Listing and Filtering\n- THE system SHALL allow users to retrieve a paginated list of their active (not deleted) tasks.\n- THE system SHALL support filtering by task status ('pending', 'completed') and by partial title match (case-insensitive substring).\n- THE system SHALL only return tasks belonging to the authenticated user.\n- THE system SHALL support customizable page size, with a maximum of 50 items per page.\n- WHEN a user requests their tasks, THE system SHALL return tasks sorted by creation date descending, unless an alternate order is specified by the user.\n- THE system SHALL return accurate total and filtered counts with each listing response to support client-side paging.\n\n### Retrieval\n- WHEN a user retrieves an individual task by ID, THE system SHALL return full task details if they own the task.\n- IF a user requests a task they do not own, THEN THE system SHALL return an authorization error.\n- IF a user requests a deleted or non-existent task, THEN THE system SHALL return a 'task not found' error.\n- WHEN users request a list of deleted tasks, THE system SHALL only include tasks deleted by the requesting user that are still within retention.\n\n### State Model\nEach task transitions through states as shown below:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Created (pending)\"] --> B[\"Edited\"]\n  B --> C[\"Completed\"]\n  B --> D[\"Deleted\"]\n  C --> D\n  D --> E[\"Restored\"]\n  E --> B\n```\n\n#### State Descriptions\n- \"Created (pending)\": Initial state after creation.\n- \"Edited\": Task was updated, remains pending until completed/deleted.\n- \"Completed\": Task is marked as finished with timestamp recorded.\n- \"Deleted\": Soft-delete state; task hidden from normal listings but recoverable.\n- \"Restored\": Task recovered from deleted state within retention period.\n\n### Permissions\n- THE system SHALL restrict all task management to the authenticated user's own data.\n- IF a user attempts batch operations (edit/delete/complete) referencing tasks they do not own, THEN THE system SHALL process only valid tasks and return an error for unauthorized IDs.\n- THE system SHALL log all rejected access attempts for audit and abuse detection.\n\n## 4. Task Editing and Completion\n\n### Requirements\n- WHEN a user edits a task, THE system SHALL allow updates ONLY to the title and description.\n- WHEN editing, THE system SHALL re-validate the updated title for length, presence, and duplication as with creation.\n- WHEN editing, THE system SHALL prevent updates to tasks marked as deleted.\n- WHEN a user marks a task as completed, THE system SHALL update the status and record the 'completed at' timestamp (UTC ISO 8601).\n- WHEN a user marks a completed task as not completed, THE system SHALL clear the 'completed at' timestamp and set the status to 'pending'.\n- IF a user attempts to edit the ID, creation timestamp, completion timestamp, or other immutable property directly, THEN THE system SHALL reject the operation with a descriptive error.\n- WHERE a task is deleted, THE system SHALL deny editing or marking completion on that task.\n- WHERE edits are attempted on tasks in a restored state, THE system SHALL enforce the same validation as for normal edits.\n- THE system SHALL log all failed or invalid edit attempts for traceability.\n\n### Error Handling\n- IF a user submits an edit with no actual data change, THEN THE system SHALL return a warning indicating no modifications were made.\n- IF an edit attempt fails validation, THEN THE system SHALL return a detailed error indicating which field(s) failed and why.\n\n### Batch Editing\n- WHEN batch edits are supported, THE system SHALL validate each task independently and process only those passing validation.\n- IF any task in a batch fails, THEN THE system SHALL not rollback successful individual updates, but SHALL report all errors with identifiers for failed items.\n\n## 5. Deletion and Restoration Rules\n\n### Soft Delete\n- WHEN a user deletes a task, THE system SHALL mark the task as 'deleted', retain all task data, and record the 'deleted at' timestamp (UTC ISO 8601).\n- DELETED tasks SHALL NOT appear in standard task listings or counts.\n- THE system SHALL provide users a means to list and restore deleted tasks within 30 days of deletion.\n- WHEN attempting deletion of an already-deleted or non-existent task, THEN THE system SHALL reject the request and indicate the reason.\n\n### Restoration\n- WHEN a user restores a deleted task within 30 days, THE system SHALL reinstate the task to its last valid state and clear the 'deleted at' timestamp.\n- IF a user tries to restore a task after 30 days, THEN THE system SHALL deny the operation and indicate the retention period has expired.\n- WHEN restoring, THE system SHALL re-validate that related parent objects (if implemented, e.g. projects/folders) exist and are accessible; IF not, THEN THE system SHALL block restoration with a dependency error.\n\n### Permanent Delete\n- WHEN a task has been deleted for over 30 days, THE system SHALL irrevocably remove all data associated with the task, including metadata and logs.\n- THE system SHALL permanently delete all tasks immediately upon explicit user request for irreversible removal.\n- WHERE data retention laws apply, THE system SHALL delay irreversible deletion for the minimum required by regulation, informing the user of the delay.\n\n### Restrictions\n- IF a user attempts to manage tasks deleted by another user (not possible by design), THEN THE system SHALL return an authorization error.\n- THE system SHALL reject restoration if a duplicate active task title would result, enforcing title uniqueness among active/restored tasks.\n- IF restoration fails due to permanent deletion, THE system SHALL display a clear message that the task cannot be recovered.\n\n### Batch Deletion/Restoration\n- THE system SHALL validate each task in batch delete/restore actions and process only those valid for the user and within retention; errors reported per task.\n\n## 6. Edge Cases\n\n### Simultaneous and Overlapping Updates\n- IF two requests attempt to modify the same task at the same time, THEN THE system SHALL serialize writes and apply the last-in modification as the effective state for conflict resolution.\n- WHERE possible, THE system SHALL detect lost update scenarios and inform users of possible data loss or concurrent modification.\n\n### Duplicate and Invalid Operations\n- IF a user attempts to create two tasks with identical (case-insensitive, trimmed) titles, THEN THE system SHALL reject the second attempt with a duplication message.\n- IF a user attempts unsupported operations (e.g., editing a deleted or permanently removed task), THEN THE system SHALL clearly communicate the error, reason, and next recommended action.\n- IF operation on tasks outside retention window (e.g., restore after 30 days), THEN THE system SHALL display permanent deletion message.\n\n### Batch and Bulk Actions\n- WHEN batch/bulk create, update, or delete are implemented, THE system SHALL validate and enforce all business rules for each task individually.\n- IF rate limit is exceeded for any user in batch process, THEN THE system SHALL halt further operations for the remainder of the window, and return error details.\n\n### Input Validation Errors\n- THE system SHALL validate all input data strictly pre-operation, including field types, lengths, required status, and special character usage.\n- IF any validation fails in any operation, THEN THE system SHALL reject the request with explicit messages for each failed input.\n\n### Performance and Experience\n- THE system SHALL return all task list and retrieval responses within 1 second for 95% of requests under normal load.\n- THE system SHALL ensure that create/edit/complete/delete operations respond within 2 seconds for 99% of valid requests.\n- IF the system experiences delays longer than 3 seconds, THEN THE system SHALL provide progress feedback and suggest retry.\n- THE system SHALL communicate remaining user rate-limit status and next-available window on every rate-limit-related rejection.\n\n### Security Consistency\n- THE system SHALL ensure all authorization, authentication, and business rule checks precede any data changes for any task-related operations.\n- THE system SHALL log all unexpected errors and expose only safe, user-appropriate error messages while retaining internal details for operator review.\n\n---\n\n# References and Related Documents\nFor information on user authentication and roles, see the [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md).

description and due date are optional but, if provided, must fit system validation rules (see [Business Rules and Validation Reference](./06-business-rules-and-validation.md)).\n   - Valid cases: system creates task, links to user, updates task list instantly.\n   - Invalid cases: system returns business rule error (e.g., missing title, title too long).\n\n2. **Viewing Task List**:\n   - User is authenticated.\n   - User requests their task list.\n   - System retrieves all tasks where `userId` matches authenticated user's ID, orders by creation date.\n   - System returns all active tasks by default; user may request completed or deleted tasks as a filter.\n   - Empty list returns clear message that no tasks are present.\n\n3. **Editing a Task**:\n   - User authenticates.\n   - User selects an editable task.\n   - System confirms task ownership and existence.\n   - User submits update; system validates new information.\n   - On success, updated task replaces previous version in user view.\n   - On failure (invalid data, not found, not owned by user), system returns error message with no changes.\n\n4. **Completing/Incompleting a Task**:\n   - User authenticates.\n   - User locates specific task, selects \"Complete\" or \"Mark Incomplete.\"\n   - System checks existence and ownership; updates status accordingly.\n   - Updated status is reflected instantly in the task list.\n   - If not found or not owned by user, error is returned.\n\n5. **Deleting a Task**:\n   - User authenticates.\n   - User selects a task to delete.\n   - System verifies the task exists and is owned by the user.\n   - System checks if the task is active; if active, changes to deleted state (soft delete); if already deleted/non-existent/not owned, returns error.\n   - Task is removed from main view within 1 second; remains available in deleted tasks list for possible restoration.\n\n6. **Restoring a Deleted Task**:\n   - User authenticates.\n   - User views tasks in deleted status.\n   - User selects a task to restore.\n   - System verifies task exists, is owned by user, and is in deleted state.\n   - On success, system restores task to active status; on failure, returns error.\n\n---\n\n## Expected Outcomes\n\n- All successful operations (add, edit, complete, delete, restore) result in instant updates to the user's task list (visible within 1 second)\n- Errors arising from invalid input or permission issues are accompanied by clear, specific user-facing messages (example: \"Task title required\", \"Task not found\", \"Access denied\")\n- Edge cases (e.g., attempting task operations on another user’s tasks, submitting overlong titles, restoring tasks not in deleted status) return appropriate error results with no effect on user’s actual task data\n- The user always has up-to-date, accurate feedback on all actions, supporting trust and usability\n\n---\n\nReferences:\n- For underlying business logic and rules, see the [Functional Requirements for Todo Item Management](./03-functional-requirements.md)\n- For user authentication and role-specific behaviors, see the [User Roles and Authentication Specification](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md)\n- For error handling processes, refer to the [Error Handling and Exception Scenarios Overview](./08-error-handling-and-exception-scenarios.md)\n"},{"reason":"To visualize and describe conceptually the step-by-step process a user follows when interacting with the todo list system.","filename":"05-user-flow.md","documentType":"user-flow","outline":["Login and Authentication Flow","Adding Tasks Flow","Editing and Completing Tasks Flow","Deleting Tasks Flow"],"audience":"development team","detailLevel":"moderate detail","content":"# User Flow for Todo List Service\n\n## Login and Authentication Flow\nA user who wishes to interact with any protected area of the todoList service must first complete authentication, establishing a valid session before any task operations can be performed.

Input Validation Rules\n\n### 2.1 General Input Policies\n- THE system SHALL validate all user inputs for task creation and modification prior to any business logic execution.\n\n### 2.2 Task Creation Validation\n- WHEN a user submits a request to create a task, THE system SHALL require the following minimum data fields:\n  - title (string, required)\n  - [optional] description (string)\n  - [optional] due date (ISO 8601 date or datetime string)\n- THE system SHALL reject creation if title is missing, empty, or exceeds 200 characters.\n- THE system SHALL limit the description field to 1000 characters; longer descriptions SHALL cause validation failure.\n- WHERE a due date is provided, THE system SHALL validate the date format is ISO 8601 and that the date is not earlier than today.\n- IF any required input validation fails, THEN THE system SHALL return an explicit, user-facing error message identifying the reason.\n\n### 2.3 Task Editing (Update) Validation\n- WHEN a user edits a task, THE system SHALL allow modification of title, description, or due date only.\n- THE system SHALL apply the same validation rules for title, description, and due date as task creation (see above).\n- THE system SHALL verify that the task exists and is owned by the requesting user before permitting updates.\n- WHERE an update request contains no changes to any fields, THE system SHALL return a warning or error indicating no modifications were detected and take no action.\n- IF a user attempts to edit a \"deleted\" task, THEN THE system SHALL deny the operation and provide a relevant error message.\n\n### 2.4 Task Status Transition Validation\n- WHEN a user marks a task as completed, THE system SHALL check that the task is not already in \"completed\" or \"deleted\" status.\n- IF a completed or deleted task is marked as complete again, THEN THE system SHALL return an error stating the action is redundant or invalid.\n- WHEN a user attempts to restore a deleted task, THE system SHALL require that the task has not exceeded the restoration period (e.g., 30 days from deletion); after which, permanent deletion MAY be enforced per additional business policy.\n- WHERE a user tries to update the status of a non-existent or unowned task, THE system SHALL reject the request with a permissions error message.\n\n### 2.5 Bulk Operations Validation\n- IF bulk task operations are supported, THE system SHALL validate that each individual task in the batch meets all relevant rules as though processed singly, including ownership, status, and input field validation.\n\n### 2.6 Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention\n- TO prevent misuse, THE system SHALL limit task creation and edit operations to 100 per user per day; excess requests SHALL be rejected with an appropriate error response.\n\n## 3. Task Status Change Rules\n\n### 3.1 Status Flow\n- THE allowed task status transitions are as follows: \"active\" → \"completed\" → [none]; \"active\" or \"completed\" → \"deleted\".\n- WHEN a task is in status \"completed\", THE system SHALL prevent further status changes to any state other than \"deleted\".\n- WHEN a task is \"deleted\", THE system SHALL allow either permanent removal or restoration to \"active\" for a fixed retention period (default: 30 days).\n\n#### Task Status Change Process (Mermaid Diagram)\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"Task Created (active)\"] --> B[\"Mark as Completed\"]\n  B --> C[\"Status: completed\"]\n  A --> D[\"Delete Task\"]\n  C --> E[\"Delete Task\"]\n  D[\"Status: deleted\"]\n  E[\"Status: deleted\"]\n  D --> F[\"Restore (Retention)\"]\n  F --> A\n  D --> G[\"Permanent Remove (after retention)\"]\n```\n\n### 3.2 Edge Case Handling for Status Changes\n- IF a user tries to restore a task outside the allowed retention window, THEN THE system SHALL return an error stating restoration is not possible.\n- IF a user attempts to mark a task as complete after it is deleted, THEN THE system SHALL reject the request with an error.\n\n## 4. Data Consistency and Transactional Integrity\n\n### 4.1 Atomicity\n- WHEN making changes to multiple tasks in bulk, THE system SHALL ensure all-or-nothing behavior: all tasks are updated or none are, ensuring no partial update states.\n\n### 4.2 Idempotency\n- THE system SHALL return the same result and system state when a valid operation is replayed with the same parameters for idempotent operations (e.g., marking a task already completed as complete again leaves system unchanged, with proper messaging).\n\n### 4.3 Orphaned Tasks Prevention\n- THE system SHALL guarantee that no task can exist in the database without a valid owning user reference.\n- THE system SHALL enforce cascading deletion: IF a user is removed, THEN all associated tasks SHALL be deleted or treated per applicable data retention rules (see [Privacy and Data Protection Requirements](./09-privacy-and-data-protection.md)).\n\n\n---\n\nThis document is the definitive reference for business rule enforcement, input validation, and state management for backend development of the TodoList application.

security relevant to a minimal todo list system.","filename":"07-non-functional-requirements.md","documentType":"requirement","outline":["Performance Expectations","Reliability and Availability","Security and Privacy","Scalability","Usability"],"audience":"development team","detailLevel":"moderate detail","content":"# Non-Functional Requirements for todoList Service\n\n## Performance Expectations\n\n- WHEN a user performs any core API operation (create, fetch, update, delete todo item), THE todoList system SHALL respond within 1 second for at least 95% of requests under normal load conditions (single user context).\n- WHEN load increases to 10x the anticipated MVP user volume (reference: 500 simultaneous users), THE system SHALL continue to deliver responses within 2 seconds for at least 90% of valid requests.\n- WHILE background processes (e.g., garbage collection of permanently deleted tasks, archival, log processing) are running, THE system SHALL not degrade interactive API response times by more than 10% of the baseline measurements.\n- IF the system is unable to meet the required response time due to resource saturation, THEN THE system SHALL return a 503 Service Unavailable error, log the root cause, and provide actionable retry information in the API response.\n- WHEN the system encounters performance degradation or API slowness, THE backend SHALL expose meaningful diagnostic telemetry (e.g., response time histogram, request volume metrics) to system maintainers for incident analysis, not to end users.\n- THE todoList system SHALL ensure that bulk operations (if available) on tasks (e.g., batch create/update/delete up to 20 tasks) complete within 3 seconds for 95% of cases.\n- WHERE concurrent modifications are possible, THE system SHALL detect and prevent race conditions that would result in data inconsistency or visible user-level errors.\n- WHEN request rate for a single authenticated user exceeds 50 API calls per minute, THE system SHALL apply standardized rate limiting and return a business-appropriate error message (see [Error Handling and Exception Scenarios](./08-error-handling-and-exception-scenarios.md)).\n- THE system SHALL complete all data storage and update operations in a transactionally safe manner to avoid intermediate/faulty states from being visible to users.\n\n## Reliability and Availability\n\n- THE todoList service SHALL be available for at least 99.9% of each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance announced at least 24 hours in advance.\n- WHEN scheduled maintenance is required, THE system SHALL provide at least 24 hours' notice through an administrative mechanism agreed with users/business stakeholders.\n- WHEN backend failures (e.g., host/network/storage) occur, THE system SHALL retry idempotent operations automatically up to 3 times before returning an error to the user.\n- WHILE a user is actively managing their own tasks, THE system SHALL maintain transactional integrity, ensuring that either the entire operation is completed or none of its effects persist (ACID behavior for business-level transactions).\n- IF the service or data store becomes temporarily unavailable, THEN THE system SHALL recover within 60 seconds and resume correct operation without user intervention.\n- WHEN a user creates, edits, or deletes a todo item, THE system SHALL persist changes in durable storage, ensuring no data loss occurs due to transient errors or crashes.\n- WHEN users indicate lost or missing data after a confirmed successful operation, THE backend SHALL provide mechanisms for verifiable business-level audit/recovery, consistent with privacy obligations (see [Privacy and Data Protection Requirements](./09-privacy-and-data-protection.md)).\n- THE system SHALL operate correctly in the face of duplicate or retried requests (due to network failures, retries, etc.) ensuring idempotency for all safe actions.\n- THE todoList service SHALL automatically monitor system health and escalate incidents to operations team when errors exceed 1% of total requests over any 5-minute window.\n- WHERE business rules or constraints prohibit action completion, THE system SHALL return clear, business-level error responses without exposing implementation or infrastructure details (see [Business Rules and Validation Requirements](./06-business-rules-and-validation.md)).\n\n## Security and Privacy\n\n- THE todoList system SHALL require authentication (JWT as defined in [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md)) for all API operations that access personal or user-created data.\n- WHEN a user attempts to perform any API operation without a valid token, THE system SHALL reject the request and return an actionable authentication error (see [Error Handling and Exception Scenarios](./08-error-handling-and-exception-scenarios.md)).\n- THE system SHALL enforce strict authorization, ensuring users can access only their own todo items and are forbidden from accessing other users' data under any scenario (see [Privacy and Data Protection Requirements](./09-privacy-and-data-protection.md)).\n- WHEN session expiration or token revocation is triggered by business rules or suspicious activity, THE backend SHALL immediately terminate affected sessions and require re-authentication for continued access.\n- WHILE user sessions are active, THE system SHALL protect session data and authentication tokens from unauthorized disclosure or reuse (enforce business expiry, rotation, and revocation policies as per [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md)).\n- THE todoList service SHALL store all user credentials as cryptographically secure hashes and never store plaintext passwords or sensitive data.\n- IF suspected malicious activity (repetitive failed logins, token reuse, anomaly detection) occurs, THEN THE system SHALL log detailed incidents, revoke affected tokens, and trigger notifications according to business escalation policies.\n- WHEN processing, updating, deleting, or exporting user data, THE backend SHALL ensure all operations comply fully with privacy obligations set out in [Privacy and Data Protection Requirements](./09-privacy-and-data-protection.md).\n- THE system SHALL never log, persist, or transmit unencrypted personal or sensitive data; all storage and network transmissions SHALL be protected using industry-standard encryption protocols.\n- WHERE backup or caching mechanisms are in place, THE backend SHALL ensure data deletion is observed across all business storage, including caches and backups, within defined business periods (see [Privacy and Data Protection Requirements](./09-privacy-and-data-protection.md)).\n\n## Scalability\n\n- THE todoList MVP SHALL support sustained operation for up to 1,000 registered users with active concurrent sessions and up to 100,000 stored todo items, with performance and reliability targets as specified above.\n- WHEN user or task volume grows beyond 100% of MVP assumptions, THE system SHALL maintain core operational and performance requirements up to 2,000 concurrent sessions and 200,000 stored items without major service degradation.\n- WHERE business patterns (e.g., user spikes, batch task imports) produce workload surges, THE backend SHALL automatically scale service resources and apply fair queuing, ensuring no user experiences starvation or excessive delays.\n- IF backend scaling limits approach business-defined thresholds, THEN THE system SHALL provide metrics and alerting to business operators to support proactive intervention and capacity planning.\n- WHEN new features or business expansion are introduced (reference [Future Considerations and Expansion](./10-future-considerations-and-expansion.md)), THE backend SHALL be designed to accommodate additional user roles, new business workflows, and increased data types/volumes with minimal code and operational rework.\n\n## Usability (from Backend/API Perspective)\n\n- THE todoList service SHALL provide a clear, well-documented business API contract consistent with organizational and industry standards for API development.\n- WHEN an API error occurs resulting from business logic (e.g., validation, permission, resource not found), THE backend SHALL deliver business-ready error responses containing actionable, plain language messages (see [Error Handling and Exception Scenarios](./08-error-handling-and-exception-scenarios.md)).\n- FOR each business error response, THE backend SHALL supply error codes aligned with the business domain and omit all internal/technical/infrastructure references.\n- THE system SHALL support discoverability of limits (e.g., max title length, max items per page, rate limits) through business documentation and/or API metadata endpoints as appropriate.\n- WHEN new API features or resources are added, THE backend SHALL follow consistent naming, structure, and contract conventions for all new endpoints and actions.\n- WHEN returning paginated or filtered lists, THE system SHALL always report total available items, current pagination, and next/previous page details in the business response payload.\n- WHEN an invalid or ambiguous API request is submitted, THE backend SHALL respond with a clear error message and business guidance for successful correction.\n- WHERE user actions can produce multiple results or validation errors, THE backend SHALL enumerate all actionable issues in a single API response to facilitate efficient error resolution by clients.\n- THE backend SHALL avoid leaking any technical stack, build, or system version identifiers in API payloads or errors, maintaining a clean business abstraction.\n\n## Reference Integration\n\n- For privacy obligations, see [Privacy and

perspective.","filename":"08-error-handling-and-exception-scenarios.md","documentType":"requirement","outline":["Error Types Overview","User-Facing Error Messages","System Handling Procedures","Error Recovery Flows"],"audience":"development team","detailLevel":"detailed specification","content":"# Error Handling and Exception Scenarios for todoList Service\n\n## 1. Error Types Overview\n\n### 1.1 Input Validation Errors\nInput validation errors occur when users provide data that does not conform to business requirements. This includes, but is not limited to, missing or empty task titles, excessively long descriptions, illegal date formats, and any field restrictions articulated in the [Business Rules and Validation](./06-business-rules-and-validation.md) documentation. WHEN the user provides invalid input for any field, THE todoList system SHALL enforce all validation and reject the submission with detailed feedback for each violated rule.\n\n### 1.2 Authentication and Authorization Errors\nAuthentication and authorization errors arise when a request is made with missing, invalid, or expired authentication tokens, or when a user attempts to perform actions outside their permitted scope as defined in the [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md). WHEN a user token is absent, expired, or invalid, THE system SHALL deny access and require re-authentication. IF a user attempts an operation on other users’ data, THEN THE system SHALL reject the action and not disclose the existence or status of other users' resources.\n\n### 1.3 Resource Not Found Errors\nResource not found errors occur when users reference todo items or resources that do not exist, have been deleted, or are inaccessible to the user. WHEN a resource identifier does not match any object accessible to the authenticated user, THE system SHALL return a not found error and must not reveal whether the resource exists in the system to unauthorized requestors.\n\n### 1.4 Conflict and Concurrency Errors\nConflict errors occur when multiple update or delete operations are attempted simultaneously on the same resource, or when duplicated create actions occur within defined business windows. WHEN concurrent modifications are detected, THE system SHALL reject conflicting operations and provide guidance for conflict resolution.\n\n### 1.5 System and Infrastructure Errors\nSystem and infrastructure errors are raised on backend service failures, database downtime, or connectivity loss. WHEN such errors arise, THE system SHALL log the incident, respond with a generic, non-disclosive message, and ensure that no sensitive internal status is revealed externally.\n\n### 1.6 Rate Limiting and Abuse Protection\nRate limiting errors protect the service against excessive or abusive usage. WHEN a user or IP exceeds usage or rate thresholds, THE system SHALL block further requests and clearly communicate timing for retry or block status. WHEN recurrent abuse patterns are observed, THE system SHALL escalate blocks and notify service operators for audit and response.\n\n## 2. User-Facing Error Messages\n\n### 2.1 Principles for Error Messaging\n- THE system SHALL ensure all error messages are clear, specific, actionable, and avoid technical jargon.\n- WHEN an error occurs, THE todoList system SHALL provide a business-relevant explanation, with next steps where feasible.\n- WHERE multiple errors exist, THE system SHALL report all relevant issues simultaneously to minimize user confusion and enable efficient resolution.\n\n### 2.2 Error Messages by Type\n| Error Category                  | Typical Business Context                                      | Example Error Message                       |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Input Validation                 | Required field missing or invalid format                     | \"Title is required.\"                        |\n| Input Validation                 | Field exceeds allowed character limit                        | \"Description cannot exceed 1000 characters.\"|\n| Authentication                   | Invalid/missing credentials; expired token                   | \"Session expired. Please log in again.\"     |\n| Forbidden (Permission)           | Attempting to access or modify another’s tasks               | \"You are not authorized to modify this item.\"|\n| Not Found                        | Reference to non-existent or deleted task                    | \"Task not found.\"                          |\n| Not Found                        | Resource outside current user’s access scope                 | \"Resource not found.\"                      |\n| Conflict/Concurrency             | Duplicate creation or concurrent update/deletion             | \"Task has been updated elsewhere. Please reload.\"|\n| Conflict/Concurrency             | Creation of duplicate task within window                     | \"A task with this title already exists.\"    |\n| Rate Limiting                    | Excessive requests or transactions                           | \"Too many requests. Please try again later.\"|\n| System/Internal                  | Downtime or unexpected processing failure                    | \"Temporary error. Please try again later.\"  |\n\n## 3. System Handling Procedures\n\n### 3.1 Input Validation\n- WHEN a user submits an invalid request, THE system SHALL validate all provided data against business rules before any processing, and reject all errors in a single response.\n- WHERE multiple fields are invalid, THE system SHALL enumerate each field-specific issue so users may correct all in one attempt.\n\n### 3.2 Authentication and Authorization\n- WHEN authentication is missing, invalid, or expired, THE system SHALL deny access and provide a message indicating login is required, as specified by authentication policy.\n- WHEN authorization fails, such as a user attempting to access or modify another user's resource, THE system SHALL not process the request, shall return a forbidden or not found message as appropriate, and never leak information about resource existence or other users.\n- WHEN excessive failed authentication attempts from a single IP or account are detected, THE system SHALL escalate by introducing delays, temporary lockouts, or CAPTCHA challenges per business security rules.\n\n### 3.3 Resource Not Found\n- WHEN a user references a deleted, unavailable, or non-existent resource, THE system SHALL return a not found error and must log the access attempt for auditing.\n- WHERE the requested resource exists but is outside the current user’s permission scope, THE system SHALL behave as for not found, avoiding information leakage.\n- WHEN a previously valid resource is no longer available due to state changes, THE system SHALL provide historic or status context where permitted by business logic.\n\n### 3.4 Conflict/Concurrency\n- WHEN simultaneous conflicting updates are attempted on the same resource, THE system SHALL serialize operations, reject or rollback as needed, and provide guidance for users to retry with latest resource state.\n- WHEN duplicate creation actions occur (e.g., double post of same task), THE system SHALL detect and reject duplicates with appropriate error messaging.\n\n### 3.5 System/Internal Errors\n- WHEN infrastructure or external dependency failures occur, THE system SHALL present a generic error, log all diagnostic details internally, and never disclose system-internal or sensitive backend status in user-facing messages.\n- WHEN partial failures occur during a multi-step business transaction, THE system SHALL revert all data to previous consistent state and ensure no data loss.\n\n### 3.6 Rate Limiting and Abuse Protections\n- WHEN a user or IP exceeds rate thresholds (as defined in business rules), THE system SHALL reject additional requests, include a retry-after indicator in the response, and log the incident.\n- WHERE abusive or bot-like activity is detected, THE system SHALL escalate to a temporary or permanent block, and block details SHALL be available for review by system operators.\n\n## 4. Error Recovery Flows\n\n### 4.1 Input Validation Recovery\n- WHEN input validation fails, THE system SHALL return all errors at once and retain submitted input so that users can correct and re-submit efficiently.\n- WHERE possible, THE system SHALL provide users with field-specific guidance for error correction.\n\n### 4.2 Authentication Recovery\n- WHEN session or token expiry is detected, THE system SHALL require the user to re-authenticate and shall not process further requests until a valid session is established.\n- IF repeated authentication failures occur, THEN THE system SHALL present additional support options or password reset guidance.\n\n### 4.3 Resource and Action Recovery\n- WHEN accidental deletion or destructive operations are detected where business rules permit undo or restoration, THE system SHALL offer an undo or recovery mechanism within the permitted window.\n- WHERE actions are permanent (e.g., irreversible delete), THE system SHALL present explicit warnings and require user confirmation before proceeding.\n\n### 4.4 Conflict and Concurrency Recovery\n- WHEN a conflict error is returned, THE system SHALL instruct users to refresh/reload data or re-initiate the transaction with the latest resource state. THE system SHALL support idempotency for safe re-attempts where business logic allows.\n\n### 4.5 System/Internal Error Recovery\n- WHEN encountering internal system errors, THE system SHALL advise users to retry after a specified interval and ensure all partial operations are appropriately reverted to preserve data integrity.\n- THE system SHALL monitor for repeated failures, and, if detected, escalate incidents for operational review.\n\n### 4.6 Rate Limiting Recovery\n- WHEN a user is rate limited, THE system SHALL specify in its response when further activity is permitted, including a retry-after timestamp, and offer information on usage limits where allowed by policy.\n\n## 5.

(e.g., System/Rate Limit)\"}\n  E -->|\"Yes\"| F[\"Advise User to Wait or Contact Support\"]\n  E -->|\"No\"| G[\"End\"]\n```\n\n## 6. Edge Cases\n\n### 6.1 Batch and Multi-Error Scenarios\n- WHEN users initiate batch operations (e.g., bulk delete or update) containing both valid and invalid requests, THE system SHALL process operations atomically if possible, or enumerate individual errors for each failed item, so that no silent failure occurs and successful items are returned with completed status.\n- WHEN multiple errors arise simultaneously in a single transaction, THE system SHALL prioritize user correction and provide a sorted list of all error messages for clarity.\n\n### 6.2 Partial System Failures\n- WHEN a system or dependency fails during an operation, THE system SHALL preserve all progress where feasible, prevent data inconsistency, and provide explanatory status indicating which steps succeeded and which were rolled back.\n- WHERE user actions cannot be completed due to temporary outages, THE system SHALL retain pending operations and attempt to resume when possible.\n\n### 6.3 Session Invalidations During Operations\n- WHEN a session becomes invalid in the middle of a multi-step process, THE system SHALL halt further processing and inform the user immediately.\n- IF a user attempts to retry with an expired or revoked token, THEN THE system SHALL reject all requests until re-authentication is performed.\n\n### 6.4 Data Loss and Recovery\n- WHEN abnormal termination or crash occurs during action processing, THE system SHALL log complete contextual information, ensure no silent data loss, and allow for troubleshooting by system operators.\n- IF data cannot be recovered, THEN THE system SHALL notify affected users accordingly at next login or request attempt.\n\n## 7. Reference Integration\n\n- Error handling requirements are aligned with [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md), [Functional Requirements for Task Management](./03-functional-requirements.md), and [Business Rules and Validation](./06-business-rules-and-validation.md). All practices described here enforce strict abstraction boundaries for information leakage, and all error flows are consistent with business permissions—the 'user' role may never see or affect other users’ data or system internals.\n- User-facing messages, error codes, recovery flows, and timeouts must not expose sensitive backend elements. All observable behaviors have been specified in business language, not technical jargon.\n\n## 8. Performance and Monitoring Requirements\n\n- WHEN an error occurs, THE system SHALL provide a user-facing response within 2 seconds of the triggering event in 99% of cases.\n- THE system SHALL log all non-trivial failures, including authentication failures, conflict/concurrency issues, and internal system errors, and retain logs for a period consistent with business monitoring policies.\n- WHEN backend monitoring detects repeated error patterns or high failure rates, THE system SHALL alert service operators for incident management and quality assurance.\n- THE todoList platform SHALL ensure logs are available for operational review within 10 minutes of an error for rapid response, and data must be anonymized before operator review to preserve privacy.\n- THE system SHALL not expose detailed error traces, stack traces, or internal database states in responses to end users under any circumstances.\n\n---\n\nBusiness requirements only.

This includes:\n- Email address used for registration\n- Authentication credentials and session tokens (password hash, JWT, etc.)\n- Todo item data, including:\n    - Task titles, descriptions, and content\n    - Creation, update, completion timestamps\n    - Task completion status\n    - Metadata linked to specific todo entries (labels, priorities, etc.)\n- Account activity logs referencing individual user actions (view, create, update, delete)\n\nWHEN a user creates, edits, or deletes a todo item, THE service SHALL classify all associated data as protected personal information, subject to all privacy controls defined below.\n\nWHERE an external authority, audit, or compliance request targets personal data, THE service SHALL restrict access to only what is legally mandated and within user notification and consent boundaries.\n\n## Data Storage Principles\n\nTHE todoList service SHALL store all personal data with robust logical separation by user, using secure methods to prevent unauthorized access, leakage, or alteration.\n\n- THE service SHALL store only data necessary to provide core todo list functionality for each user and SHALL minimize data collection and retention in all subsystems.\n- THE service SHALL never store plaintext authentication credentials, and SHALL ensure password hashes, tokens, and personal identifiers are protected using industry-standard practices.\n- THE service SHALL store todo items solely within the account context of the authenticated user; cross-account data visibility is strictly prohibited.\n\nWHEN a user registers an account, THE service SHALL securely store all necessary authentication and profile data and SHALL establish a logical relationship between the user and all subsequent todo items.\n\nWHILE an authenticated session is active, THE service SHALL restrict access to todo data and personal information to only the verified user. No backend operation SHALL permit access to data belonging to any other account.\n\nWHERE user authentication information or tokens are generated, THE service SHALL store them solely for legitimate session management, never transmitting or exposing them to unauthorized entities or contexts.\n\nWHERE personal data resides in system backups, logs, or caches, THE service SHALL enforce the same logical access controls and SHALL ensure timely removal upon user or regulatory-initiated data deletion.\n\nIF technical logs or backups contain personal identifiers, THEN THE service SHALL redact or remove such information where business-justified retention ends, and SHALL make those datasets inaccessible to normal system or support operations after the retention window.\n\n## Access Control and Sharing\n\nTHE todoList service SHALL implement role-based access control in strict alignment with the [User Roles and Authentication Requirements](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md):\n- Each user may only access, retrieve, update, or delete their own todo items, metadata, and account configuration.\n- No user SHALL access another user's todo items or account data under any circumstance, regardless of means or intent.\n- No user or external entity SHALL share, transfer, or publish any todo data via the application. Public or third-party integration is prohibited unless explicitly covered by future expansion and user consent.\n- Data access, even by maintenance, compliance, or developer staff, requires documented business or legal justification and SHALL be logged and auditable.\n\nWHEN a data access attempt is made (including create, view, update, delete, export), THE service SHALL:\n- Authenticate and validate the requesting user's session and rights based on role\n- Deny access and provide a specific, actionable error when authentication fails or scope is exceeded\n- Record the attempted access, including metadata, in a secure audit trail visible to compliance authorities upon request\n\nIF unauthorized access is attempted, THEN THE service SHALL deny the operation, log the failed attempt with contextual metadata, and provide a business-appropriate error as described in the [Error Handling and Exception Scenarios](./08-error-handling-and-exception-scenarios.md).\n\nWHEN external legal or regulatory entities request access to personal data, THE service SHALL verify the authenticity and legal scope of the request, SHALL inform the user as permitted by law, and SHALL record a complete transaction log.\n\n## Data Subject Rights, Transparency, and Control\n\nTHE user SHALL have granular control over their personal data, including but not limited to the rights to:\n- View all personal and account data stored\n- Export all todo data in a human-readable and widely compatible format (e.g., CSV, JSON)\n- Correct or update personal account and todo data\n- Delete individual todo items or entire account (triggering full data removal)\n- Request an audit history of all access to their data\n\nWHEN the user initiates a data access, export, correction, or deletion request, THE service SHALL:\n- Complete the operation within 1 business day in the case of deletion, and within 3 seconds for real-time actions under normal conditions\n- Confirm completion to the user via a business-appropriate success message\n\nIF technical or legal limitations prevent fulfillment of a user request, THEN THE service SHALL notify the user immediately, explain the limitation, and offer remediation steps per compliance rules.\n\nWHEN a user requests export of their data, THE service SHALL package all tasks, account metadata, and activity logs (where not prohibited by law) in a downloadable and portable format within 3 seconds for ordinary datasets, and within 1 business day for large or archived histories.\n\nWHEN a user requests a full access history, THE service SHALL provide a detailed report including action, timestamp, and source of every business-relevant access event, as allowed by business retention and privacy rules.\n\n## Retention, Deletion, and Backup Policies\n\nTHE todoList service SHALL apply strict retention and deletion policies:\n- User data is retained only for as long as the user account is active and only for legitimate business purposes\n- When a todo item is deleted by the user, THE service SHALL remove that item from normal access immediately and mark it for permanent deletion from all storage, including backups, within 30 days\n- When a user account is deleted, THE service SHALL:\n    - Remove or render inaccessible all personal and account data, including todos, credentials, and relevant logs\n    - Expire all authentication/session tokens instantly\n    - Confirm final deletion to the user (where feasible)\n- No personal data SHALL be retained longer than business or legal justification permits. Where legal retention overrides immediate deletion (e.g., fraud, security, regulatory retention orders), the user SHALL be notified of scope, duration, and rationale whenever permitted by law.\n- Backups and logs containing deleted user data SHALL be purged or redacted within 30 days of original deletion event (unless retention exceptions above apply).\n\nWHEN an error or system problem prevents timely deletion, THE service SHALL:\n- Notify the user with a business-appropriate message\n- Retry deletion at regular intervals until successful\n- Provide audit visibility to system operators and, where allowed, to the user\n\nIF a deletion request is made for data not found (already removed), THEN THE service SHALL return a successful confirmation with a message stating no such data is present.\n\nIF attempts to access previously deleted data occur, THEN THE service SHALL deny access and inform the user that the resource is unavailable, as described in the [Error Handling and Exception Scenarios](./08-error-handling-and-exception-scenarios.md).\n\n## Incident Handling and Notification\n\nWHEN the service detects a data breach, privacy incident, or unauthorized data exposure:\n- THE service SHALL notify affected users and, if required, relevant authorities without undue delay, specifying nature, scope, and remediation steps\n- THE service SHALL log all incident events, responses, and notifications in a manner auditable by compliance and management teams\n- THE service SHALL provide users with contact information for data protection inquiries and resolution\n- THE service SHALL cooperate fully with legally-mandated investigations and preserve evidence required by law\n\n## Auditing, Compliance, and Policy Review\n\nTHE todoList service SHALL maintain a detailed, immutable audit trail for all personal data access, modification, export, and deletion events, including timestamp, initiating party, nature of change, and outcome.\n\n- Compliance with applicable data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA, or relevant regional frameworks) SHALL be reviewed at minimum annually, with updates documented and tracked for transparency\n- Users SHALL be notified of meaningful changes to privacy and data protection policies before changes take effect, with clear opt-in or opt-out mechanisms where required\n- Internal policy reviews SHALL consider evolving threats, emerging regulatory requirements, business expansion, and user feedback\n\n## Performance Requirements for Privacy Operations\n\nWHEN processing any privacy-related user request (such as data access, export, correction, or deletion), THE service SHALL:\n- Respond to interactive, non-bulk requests (e.g., exporting 1,000 or fewer items) within 3 seconds under normal load\n- Complete large or archival data operations (beyond 10,000 items or multiple years of account history) within 1 business day\n- Provide clear progress and completion feedback for all privacy operations, including queued executions in case of system load\n\n## Edge Cases and Exception Handling\n\n- IF a user submits repeated deletion, access, or export requests while data is still pending final removal, THEN THE service SHALL provide accurate status and estimated completion timeline in the user’s interface or API response\n- WHERE system maintenance, migration, or backup creates a duplicate of personal data, THE service SHALL ensure both principal and duplicate copies are purged together upon final deletion\n- IF regulatory agencies or business auditors request a data freeze (e.g., litigation hold), THEN THE service SHALL suspend non-essential deletion and inform the user of the legal basis and projected impact\n- WHERE data residuals may persist temporarily outside of principal storage (e.g., search indexing, cache), THE service SHALL wipe such traces within 30 days and before any subsequent data restoration or re-association\n\n## Example User-Initiated Data Export Workflow\n\nWHEN a user initiates a request to export all personal data:\n- THE service SHALL allow the user access to an export function in account settings\n- THE service SHALL authenticate and verify the user's session\n- THE service SHALL collect all tasks, account details, and metadata\n- THE service SHALL format the data as a downloadable archive (CSV, JSON, or user-selected format)\n- THE user SHALL be notified when the export is complete, with instructions for secure download\n- IF export fails or exceeds safe delivery limits, THEN THE service SHALL offer retries or segment exports with user confirmation\n- All events SHALL be recorded in the user’s data access audit log\n\n## Mermaid Diagram – Personal Data Lifecycle and Control\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n
