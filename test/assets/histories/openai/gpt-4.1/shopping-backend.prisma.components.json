{"type":"prismaComponents","created_at":"2025-08-04T04:57:59.359Z","thinking":"Based on the provided AIMall backend documentation, I identify several key business domains: Systematic (platform configuration, sections, channels), Actors (customers, sellers, administrators), Product Management (products, options, categories, bundles, inventory, SKUs), Cart System (shopping carts and items), Order and Delivery (orders, order items, payment, shipments, returns), Discount and Loyalty (coupons, campaigns, points, loyalty, abuse incidents), Community (posts, reviews, comments, attachments, moderation), and Analytics/Audit (activity logs, dashboards). Table names must always use the snake_case convention, be plural, and have the prefix 'aimall_backend_' as specified. User roles (customer, seller, administrator) must be kept separate as individual tables. Relationships are influenced by the ERDs described in most sections (e.g., customers -> addresses, sellers -> products/orders, admins -> sellers and audit logs).","review":"Upon review, some entities naturally cross domains (e.g., audit logs for admins and actions in multiple domains; analytics/dashboards referenced in both seller and global contexts; posts and attachments relate to both reviews and articles). These are kept in the most cohesive/primary domain according to their ownership and core usage. Cart data is kept isolated as per pre-checkout behavior; points and loyalty reward entities are distinct but integrated with discounts for a unified promotion/engagement domain. AI/Analytics-specific tables are included as a separate domain, supporting insights for admins and sellers but not polluting core transactional tables.","decision":"Final decision: Organize tables into the following main domains: Systematic, Actors, ProductManagement, Carts, Orders, Coupons, Coins, Community, Analytics. This follows strong separation-of-concerns and DDD. All table names use the 'aimall_backend_' prefix with snake_case pluralization, and each file is ordered according to typical dependency layering for database generation. Namespaces use PascalCase. Filenames are set using schema-XX-{domain}.prisma convention and each contains 3-15 tables as best practice for maintainability.","components":[{"filename":"schema-01-systematic.prisma","namespace":"Systematic","thinking":"Systematic tables define static platform configuration and categorizations (sections, channels, global configs) referenced by multiple modules, as well as product categories, channel mappings, and material shared references.","review":"Regional/currency settings, platform-wide configs, channel definitions, and product category mappings are foundational for other modules (e.g., products, orders).
