[{"name":"Actors","description":"This group represents the Actors schema area, corresponding to the `todolist_basicusers` table in the Prisma schema (from schema-01-actors.prisma). This table is foundational for user identity, authentication, privacy, and account lifecycle management. It contains the business logic for user registration, login credential storage (hashed passwords), lockout status for brute-force protections, timestamps for creation and profile changes, and soft deletion to support privacy workflows. All business operations for registration, authentication, and privacy-compliant account deactivation are mapped to this group. There are no admin or elevated roles; all business flows are for \"basicUser\" and include CRUD operations for user profile handling, as well as soft deletion (account deactivation) using the deleted_at field. The `todolist_basicusers` table is related via a one-to-many relationship to `todolist_todos`, as every todo is owned by one user. This group enforces unique constraints on user emails and supports account lifecycle through creation, soft deletion, lockout, and audit tracking by timestamps. Operations include registration, profile update, account deletion (soft and hard delete), lockout management, and listing/searching users for business purposes such as privacy export or session validation."},{"name":"Todos","description":"This group encompasses all business logic and schema elements related to the core todo management functionality for the Todo list application, and is structured around the `todolist_todos` table defined in schema-02-todos.prisma. Every todo is a private entity tied by a strict foreign key relationship to one basic user (todolist_basicuser_id → todolist_basicusers.id). The `todolist_todos` table implements all required business fields: title (1-255 chars, required), optional description (max 2000 chars), optional due date (future/now, never past), completion status (boolean), timestamps for creation, update, and completion, and a nullable soft deletion field (`deleted_at`). CRUD and filtered search operations on todos support listing by user ID, status, and title for every ownership boundary. All modifications are validated for ownership, state transitions (open/completed), and business field constraints. Deletion is soft by default (deleted_at). The group supports all CRUD, ownership, and status workflow endpoints for business logic, including atomic updates and restrictions on access to only authenticated users’ own data. This group is the core of the application's task lifecycle management, enforcing all cross-field validation and query business logic required by the documentation."}]
