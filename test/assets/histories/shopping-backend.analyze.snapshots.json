AI Shop Bulletin Board Plan\n\n## Overview\nThe AI Shop Bulletin Board is a core module supporting dynamic interaction between customers, sellers, and admins. It enables product-related announcements, Q&A, discussions, and marketing communication. Enhanced with AI-driven moderation, historical snapshotting, comment threading, rich attachments, and a smart recommendation engine, it aims to foster engagement while maintaining high content quality and compliance.\n\n## Objectives\n- Empower all user roles (customer, seller, admin) to participate with role-based permissions\n- Ensure safe, compliant, and engaging content with automated and manual moderation\n- Preserve transparency and auditability via version history of all posts/edits\n- Support deep discussions with hierarchical (threaded) comments and mentions\n- Provide seamless file/attachment management for richer, media-enabled posts\n- Suggest relevant content to users to maximize retention and satisfaction\n\n## User Scenarios\n- A customer browses a product page and asks a question via the Q&A bulletin board\n- A seller posts an update or promotion, tagging specific products and attaching images or files\n- An admin monitors flagged content and quickly restores a previous version if a post is edited maliciously\n- Users discover recommended community threads based on purchasing behavior and activity\n\n## Functional Requirements\n| Feature                   | Customer | Seller | Admin |\n|---------------------------|:--------:|:------:|:-----:|\n| View boards & posts       |    ✔     |   ✔    |   ✔   |\n| Create/edit/delete posts  |    ✔     |   ✔    |   ✔

media uploads scanned for viruses, size and type limits enforced\n- Response latency for posting and viewing must be within 1 second (P95)\n- AI moderation must respond in under 3 seconds per post\n- All version snapshots are immutable and retained for audit\n- Compliance with data privacy (GDPR/CCPA as applicable)\n\n## Content Recommendation Logic\n- Leverages AI models to suggest posts based on:\n  - User activity history, purchases, role/interests\n  - Post popularity, recency, and engagement rate\n  - Content vector similarity and collaborative filtering\n- Configurable via admin panel with toggleable model parameters\n\n## Version History & Snapshotting\n- Every post and comment action (create/edit/delete) generates a snapshot\n- History accessible via UI for admins, optionally for users\n- Rollback possible to any previous state by admin only\n\n## Comment Hierarchy & Mentions\n- Infinite comment threading (replies to replies) supported with visual nesting\n- Users can mention others using @username to trigger notifications\n\n## Attachment System\n- Attach images, files, and links to posts/comments\n- Attachment preview and download support\n- Quota management per role and per post\n\n## AI Moderation Workflow\n- On post/comment creation, text/images processed through AI moderation filters\n- Flagged content held for admin review; false positives/negatives tracked for continuous model improvement\n- Admin panel includes moderation dashboard and configuration interface\n\n## ERD (Entity-Relationship Overview)\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n  USER ||--o{ POST : creates\n

Provide concrete examples, exception cases, and potential edge-case behaviors for requirements and flows.\n\n2. **Reference Link Check**:  \n   There are two reference hyperlinks:\n   - [Table of Contents](./00_ai_shop_toc.md)\n   - [System Architecture & Compliance](./11_ai_shop_system_architecture_and_compliance.md)  \n   Since this document is not a table of contents page (does not start with 00), these links are permitted and do not require clearing or rewriting the document.\n\n3. **Content Density and Utility**:  \n   The content under each heading is currently very concise, sometimes only a bulleted list without further narrative or illustration.\n   - Expand each persona with use case stories and additional context.\n   - For user journeys, not only describe the steps but add possible variations (e.g., what happens on failure, how preferences are updated, etc.).\n   - Functional and non-functional requirements should have examples and clear definitions of boundaries/limitations.\n   - Illustrate the AI personalization section with a sample flow, pseudo-code, or decision tree logic.\n   - Add sample data structures or API call descriptions for clarity.\n\n**Instructions:**  \nExpand the document within the current page as follows:\n- Add detailed paragraphs/subsections under each heading, providing scenarios, sample data, edge cases, and more elaborate requirements.\n- For \"User Personas,\" include for each persona at least one concrete example scenario and decision logic (e.g., what makes a favorite item surface higher in recommendations?).\n- For \"Requirements\" sections, illustrate at least two edge cases and how the system should handle them.\n- For \"High-Level System Flow,\" provide a more granular breakdown, such as error handling, alternative paths, and interaction with AI modules.\n- Ensure that the total text is above 6,000 characters and that every section has substantial content.\n\n**Do not** remove reference links since they are allowed in this context.  \n**Do not** reference or request any other pages.  \nFocus solely on expanding the current \"AI Shop Favorites System\" document as instructed.","total":36,"completed":13,"step":0,"created_at":"2025-07-22T14:16:14.520Z"},"tokenUsage":{"facade":{"aggregate":{"total":298624,"input":{"total":281894,"cached":8960},"output":{"total":16730,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":298624,"input":{"total":281894,"cached":8960},"output":{"total":16730,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"analyze":{"aggregate":{"total":286066,"input":{"total":269448,"cached":8960},"output":{"total":16618,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":286066,"input":{"total":269448,"cached":8960},"output":{"total":16618,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"prisma":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"interface":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"test":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"realize":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":

AI Shop – Seller & Admin Management\n\n## 1. Overview\nThis document details the management features and workflows for sellers and administrators in the AI Shop platform. It covers the lifecycle of seller onboarding, privileges, content and product management, admin oversight, permission hierarchies, and compliance with business logic. Seller and admin management is core to ensuring marketplace quality, integrity, and efficient operations.\n\n## 2. Objectives\n- Enable smooth onboarding for new sellers while enforcing robust verification.\n- Clarify all seller privileges, approval workflows, and escalation paths.\n- Define administrative controls, including user management, logging, and dispute resolution.\n- Ensure strict role and permission separation to preserve system security.\n- Uphold compliance, auditability, and platform trust across all operations.\n\n## 3. Seller Management Features\n### 3.1 Seller Onboarding & Verification\n- **Step 1:** Seller applies via registration form (business info, required docs, terms agreement).\n- **Step 2:** Admin reviews submitted profiles, verifies credentials, and approves/rejects.\n- **Step 3:** Upon approval, seller receives access credentials and dashboard.\n- Automated identity/document scan APIs can be leveraged.\n- KYC/AML checks configurable by admin for risk management.\n\n### 3.2 Seller Dashboard Capabilities\n- Product listing creation & management\n- Inventory and pricing updates\n- Order fulfillment tools & shipping controls\n- Analytics: sales metrics, transaction history\n- Promotions: discount setup, content updates\n- Communication: respond to customer inquiries, send bulletins\n\n### 3.3 Seller Account Auditing & Actions\n- Audit trails for all seller operations (product edit, price changes, shipment)mapped to sellerID/time stamp.\n- Seller account status: active, suspended, or terminated\n- Admin can initiate actions: warn, suspend, or revoke selling privileges after review.\n\n## 4. Admin Management Features\n### 4.1 Admin Dashboard & Controls\n- Comprehensive user management (approve/reject sellers, manage user roles)\n- Configure channel-specific shop settings\n- Access to sales analytics and audit logs\n- Advanced filter/search for disputes, seller history, and order issues\n\n### 4.2 Role & Permission Separation\n- **Customer:** Browsing, purchasing, review, profile management only\n- **Seller:** Restricted to their store management, cannot access platform admin or other sellers\n- **Admin:** Full system privileges—user and content moderation, audit, compliance enforcement\n\n### 4.3 Compliance, Disputes, and Audit Logging\n- Full change history for users/sellers, product edits, and sensitive actions\n- Tools for dispute case assignment, tracking, and resolution\n- Automated alert/reporting for suspicious seller or customer behavior\n\n## 5. ERD & Data Relationships (Seller & Admin Core)\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n    SELLER ||--o{ PRODUCT : manages\n    SELLER ||--o{ ORDER : fulfills\n    SELLER ||--o{ BULLETIN : posts\n    ADMIN ||--o{ SELLER : approves\n    ADMIN ||--o{ AUDIT_LOG : generates\n    SELLER }|..|{ CUSTOMER : communicates\n```\n\n## 6. Acceptance Criteria\n- Sellers can only perform actions within their role-specific dashboard.\n- Seller onboarding requires document verification and explicit admin approval.\n- All admin interventions are audit-logged with timestamp and actor ID.\n- Sellers cannot self-approve privileges or bypass admin reviews.\n- Admins can suspend or revoke seller privileges per business policies.\n\n---\nReturn to [AI Shop Table of Contents](./00_ai_shop_toc.md)."},"review":"The document `04_ai_shop_seller_admin_management.md` covers Seller & Admin Management for AI Shop and contains a well-structured outline with detailed feature explanations for onboarding, roles, dashboards, audits, permissions, and data modeling.

AI Shop Bulletin Board Plan\n\n## Overview\nThe AI Shop Bulletin Board is a core module supporting dynamic interaction between customers, sellers, and admins. It enables product-related announcements, Q&A, discussions, and marketing communication. Enhanced with AI-driven moderation, historical snapshotting, comment threading, rich attachments, and a smart recommendation engine, it aims to foster engagement while maintaining high content quality and compliance.\n\n## Objectives\n- Empower all user roles (customer, seller, admin) to participate with role-based permissions\n- Ensure safe, compliant, and engaging content with automated and manual moderation\n- Preserve transparency and auditability via version history of all posts/edits\n- Support deep discussions with hierarchical (threaded) comments and mentions\n- Provide seamless file/attachment management for richer, media-enabled posts\n- Suggest relevant content to users to maximize retention and satisfaction\n\n## User Scenarios\n- A customer browses a product page and asks a question via the Q&A bulletin board\n- A seller posts an update or promotion, tagging specific products and attaching images or files\n- An admin monitors flagged content and quickly restores a previous version if a post is edited maliciously\n- Users discover recommended community threads based on purchasing behavior and activity\n\n## Functional Requirements\n| Feature                   |

media uploads scanned for viruses, size and type limits enforced\n- Response latency for posting and viewing must be within 1 second (P95)\n- AI moderation must respond in under 3 seconds per post\n- All version snapshots are immutable and retained for audit\n- Compliance with data privacy (GDPR/CCPA as applicable)\n\n## Content Recommendation Logic\n- Leverages AI models to suggest posts based on:\n  - User activity history, purchases, role/interests\n  - Post popularity, recency, and engagement rate\n  - Content vector similarity and collaborative filtering\n- Configurable via admin panel with toggleable model parameters\n\n## Version History & Snapshotting\n- Every post and comment action (create/edit/delete) generates a snapshot\n- History accessible via UI for admins, optionally for users\n- Rollback possible to any previous state by admin only\n\n## Comment Hierarchy & Mentions\n- Infinite comment threading (replies to replies) supported with visual nesting\n- Users can mention others using @username to trigger notifications\n\n## Attachment System\n- Attach images, files, and links to posts/comments\n- Attachment preview and download support\n- Quota management per role and per post\n\n## AI Moderation Workflow\n- On post/comment creation, text/images processed through AI moderation filters\n- Flagged content held for admin review; false positives/negatives tracked for continuous model improvement\n- Admin panel includes moderation dashboard and configuration interface\n\n## ERD (Entity-Relationship Overview)\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n  USER ||--o{ POST : creates\n

AI Shop Bulletin Board Plan\n\n## Overview\nThe AI Shop Bulletin Board is a core module supporting dynamic interaction between customers, sellers, and admins. It enables product-related announcements, Q&A, discussions, and marketing communication. Enhanced with AI-driven moderation, historical snapshotting, comment threading, rich attachments, and a smart recommendation engine, it aims to foster engagement while maintaining high content quality and compliance.\n\n## Objectives\n- Empower all user roles (customer, seller, admin) to participate with role-based permissions\n- Ensure safe, compliant, and engaging content with automated and manual moderation\n- Preserve transparency and auditability via version history of all posts/edits\n- Support deep discussions with hierarchical (threaded) comments and mentions\n- Provide seamless file/attachment management for richer, media-enabled posts\n- Suggest relevant content to users to maximize retention and satisfaction\n\n## User Scenarios\n- A customer browses a product page and asks a question via the Q&A bulletin board\n- A seller posts an update or promotion, tagging specific products and attaching images or files\n- An admin monitors flagged content and quickly restores a previous version if a post is edited maliciously\n- Users discover recommended community threads based on purchasing behavior and activity\n\n## Functional Requirements\n| Feature                   |

AI Shop Discount and Payment System\n\n## 1. Overview\nThe Discount and Payment System is a core module of the AI Shop ecosystem designed to enable flexible discounts, seamless payments, and robust management of promotional activities. This system manages digital coupons, promotions, customer deposits, mileage points, and the entire payment lifecycle, while leveraging AI to determine eligibility, optimize campaigns, and manage fraud risk. It also supports bulk operations and donation-eligible transactions.\n\n## 2. Objectives\n- Offer a competitive and dynamic shopping experience by introducing targeted, intelligent promotions.\n- Streamline payments using multiple methods, reducing friction for customers and sellers.\n- Prevent discount abuse and fraud using AI-powered monitoring.\n- Enable efficient bulk distribution of coupons and promotions.\n- Provide infrastructure for tracking, auditing, and reporting on all discount-related transactions.\n- Facilitate the handling of charity-linked/ donation-eligible sales where applicable.\n\n## 3. Discount Types Supported\n- **Digital Coupons**: Single-use, multi-use, stackable, or exclusive. Issued via campaigns, personalized AI offers, or seller/admin initiations.\n- **Automatic Promotions**: Time-based discounts, seasonal events, and cart-level promotional logic.\n- **Deposits**: Prepaid credits used for purchases and refunds. Fully auditable in customer and seller ledgers.\n- **Mileage Points**: Loyalty accrual, expirable, redeemable for discounts or rewards. Includes tiered benefit logic.\n- **Donation Coupons**: Coupons linked to charitable contributions, with full compliance and tracking.\n\n## 4. Discount Logic & Eligibility (AI-Driven)\n- AI engine predicts eligibility and optimal discount values per user/session, using:\n    - Shopping history, purchase frequency, segment membership\n    - Cart value thresholds, product eligibility, and stock level\n    - Real-time fraud signal checks (device, IP, behavioral patterns)\n- Business rules permit overrides for manually targeted campaigns\n- AI-guarded caps on maximum discount usage per period (user, campaign, or system-wide)\n\n## 5. Fraud Prevention & Abuse Controls\n- Pattern monitoring: rapid coupon claims, unusual purchase behaviors, device/IP tracking\n- Dynamic rule-updates: blacklist/whitelist, suspicious seller/product auto-flagging\n- Manual audit trails and admin review dashboards\n\n## 6. Discount Tracking, Bulk Operations, and Audit\n- Bulk coupon/promotional code creation, assignment, and validity tracking\n- Campaign scheduling and auto-expiry for all digital incentives\n- Tamper-proof transaction records for coupon lifecycle (issued, claimed, used, expired)\n- Seller/admin dashboards for tracking campaign effectiveness and coupon burn rates\n\n## 7. Payment System Integration\n- Support for major card/bank gateways, digital wallets, and alternative payments\n- Discount, deposit, and mileage redemption applied at checkout, with split-settlement logic enabling seamless merchant credit\n- Full refund and adjustment handling for orders with applied discounts\n- Real-time payment status updates, reconciliation, and reporting APIs\n\n## 8. Donation Handling\n- Flow for applying donation-linked discounts, ensuring transparency for both donor and recipient\n- Compliance with applicable local/industry regulations (e.g., donation receipts, eligibility)\n\n[Return to Table of

a customer can do, plus manage products, view analytics, promotion tools, interact with customers for support.\n- **Security:** Stronger 2FA recommended; history/audit logs for actions (product edits, pricing changes).\n\n### Admin\n- **Access:** System admin provisioned accounts must use mandatory strong authentication (password + 2FA required).\n- **Capabilities:** Manage users/sellers, review and approve sellers, audit platform activity/logs, configure channels/categories, handle complaints/disputes, monitor compliance, enforce business/policy rules.\n- **Security:** Auditable actions, higher security policies, IP restriction options, activity logging for all sensitive/admin operations.\n\n## Access Control and Authentication Flows\n- Authentication performed via API (OAuth2 or JWT recommended)\n- Each request’s token grants role-based permissions only (principle of least privilege)\n- Session timeout policies vary per role—stricter for admin\n- Roles are mutually exclusive per session context; role escalation requires explicit re-authentication and admin approval\n\n## User Lifecycle Management\n### Registration and Verification\n- Customers self-register; verification via email/SMS\n- Sellers must be approved by admin after document and business review\n- Admins are provisioned by super-admin or system config\n\n### Role Escalation / Demotion\n- Customers may apply to become sellers; subject to admin approval and business verification\n- Sellers may request account downgrade (subject to completion of order obligations)\n- Admin/super-admin controls all role changes, with a full audit trail maintained\n\n### Suspension & Termination\n- Admins may temporarily suspend or permanently terminate accounts per business rules\n- All suspensions/demotions trigger notification and appropriate logging\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- Data privacy: All roles’ data managed per data protection/regulations\n- Audit logging: All sensitive actions logged\n- Security: TLS enforced everywhere, strong password policies, brute-force prevention\n- High availability for role management services\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All role definitions and permissions are strictly enforced by API authentication\n- All onboarding, escalation, demotion, and suspension/termination flows are implemented per above\n- Security protocols (2FA, logging, session policies) operate as described\n- No external or cross-document references; this document stands

System Architecture & Compliance\n**Architecture Considerations:**\n- The Cart and Order System is modular, supporting microservice-based deployment to ensure scalability and maintainability. Key flows (cart management, order processing, payment integration) communicate via secure, well-documented APIs, with clear role-based access controls for customers, sellers, and admins.\n- Session management ensures carts are persistent across devices. Cloud-native event handling supports real-time stock updates and AI-powered recommendation delivery.\n- Data synchronization and transactional integrity are enforced, minimizing the risk of double ordering or mismatched inventory.\n\n**Compliance Principles:**\n- All user and order data are protected via encryption in transit and at rest. Privacy is maintained in accordance with applicable laws (e.g., GDPR, local data regulations).\n- Logging, auditing, and traceability are built in, allowing admins to monitor actions and investigate anomalies or disputes.\n- Automated checks support regulatory adherence (anti-fraud, payment security, consumer rights for returns/cancellations).\n- Change management and periodic reviews ensure ongoing compliance with evolving regulations and best practices.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Acceptance Criteria\n- Users can add, edit, and remove cart items seamlessly (across sessions/devices).\n- AI-driven suggestions and reminders work as described without disrupting normal flow.\n- Order status reflects accurate, real-time updates accessible to all roles with appropriate permissions.\n- Compliance with data privacy, auditing, and security requirements is rigorously enforced.\n"},"total":36,"completed":24,"step":0,"created_at":"2025-07-22T14:16:41.517Z"},"tokenUsage":{"facade":{"aggregate":{"total":461866,"input":{"total":438649,"cached":10752},"output":{"total":23217,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":461866,"input":{"total":438649,"cached":10752},"output":{"total":23217,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"analyze":{"aggregate":{"total":449308,"input":{"total":426203,"cached":10752},"output":{"total":23105,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":449308,"input":{"total":426203,"cached":10752},"output":{"total":23105,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"prisma":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"interface":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"test":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"realize":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_predict

The ERD and acceptance criteria are also clearly described.\n\nHowever, to ensure maximum clarity and developer guidance, do the following:\n\n1. The sections titled \"User Personas\", \"Customer Lifecycle Journey\", \"Functional Requirements\", and \"Non-Functional Requirements\" each currently contain only brief descriptions or lists.\n   - Expand each of these sections with detailed, paragraph-level explanations and real business context scenarios that developers might encounter. For example, provide more specifics on what each persona expects in terms of features, walk through a detailed customer lifecycle scenario, elaborate on the implications of each functional requirement, and cite real-world compliance consequences for non-functional aspects.\n\n2. The \"Analytics & Personalization\" bullet under \"Functional Requirements\" is especially brief. Add specific examples and use cases (e.g., how RFM analysis informs campaigns, how churn prediction integrates with customer notifications, and how personalization is triggered by behavioral signals).\n\n3. Acceptance criteria are sound but could use expanded scenario-based examples. For each acceptance criterion, provide an example scenario covering expected system/user actions and success conditions.\n\n4. Add a clear \"Definitions\" or \"Glossary\" subsection near the beginning if any domain-specific terms (e.g., RFM, GDPR, OAuth, SSO) might be unclear to developers.\n\n5.

AI Shop Favorites System\n\n[Table of Contents](./00_ai_shop_toc.md)\n\n## Overview\nThe AI Shop Favorites System is engineered to deliver personalized, dynamic management of favorite (bookmarked) items across product, inquiry, address, and notification categories. Leveraging AI algorithms, the system not only hosts traditional favorites operations (add/remove/view) but also intelligently surfaces, organizes, and recommends items based on evolving user preferences and contextual behaviors. This is a cross-module capability, accessible from product listings, detail views, user dashboards, and notification streams, making it a cornerstone for consistent user engagement and retention across device types and roles.\n\n## Objectives\n- Enable one-click addition and removal of favorites for products, inquiries, addresses, and notifications.\n- Provide AI-driven personalized favorites sorting and suggestions based on behavior history, stated interests, and contextual signals (e.g., season, promotions, stock changes).\n- Maintain robustness and clarity across exception cases (e.g., duplicate addition, deleted items, privacy restrictions).\n- Support advanced features such as batch-operations, favoriting limits, and smart folders.\n- Ensure full auditability and compliance with data privacy laws.\n\n## User Personas\n**Customer Persona**: \"Anna, the Variety Shopper\"\n- Anna is an active shopper who loves to explore trending and seasonal products. She frequently bookmarks items to compare, reorder, or watch for future discounts. For Anna, AI-organized favorites prioritize items with upcoming sales, those recently viewed, or ones with low stock.\n- *Scenario*: Anna favorites three handbags, two of which go on sale. The system pushes these products to the top of her favorites, notifying her of discounts. If Anna removes a favorite due to price increase, the AI learns to deprioritize similar items.\n\n**Seller Persona**: \"Leo, the Inventory Optimizer\"\n- Leo, as a seller, uses favorites to monitor competitive products and buyer inquiries. He wants to favorite certain repeat questions for quick response and frequently-watched competitor listings.\n- *Scenario*: Leo bookmarks high-performing competitor sneakers. After a stockout, the system recommends similar sneakers and sends trends based on his favorites.\n\n**Admin Persona**: \"Mina, the Compliance Guardian\"\n- Admins track favorites engagement, monitor for abuse or fraud (e.g., bots mass-favoriting products), and ensure privacy-compliant management.\n- *Scenario*: Mina observes a spike in favorites for a suspicious product, triggers an audit, and the system provides behavioral logs and AI-detected anomalies.\n\n## User Journeys\n**Customer Journey:**\n1. Anna browses bags and clicks “Add to Favorites” on several items. The UI confirms addition; duplicates return an “Already in favorites” toast.\n2. Favorites are grouped (e.g., by type or sale status) and sorted using AI (recent activity, promotions, personalized ranking).\n3. If a favorite is discontinued, Anna receives an alert and the item is moved to an “Unavailable” section.\n4. Anna selects multiple favorites for bulk removal; edge case: attempting to remove items already deleted from catalog prompts a skip/removal notification.\n5. Preference updates, such as a newly set favorite category, dynamically alter future recommendations.\n\n**Seller/Admin Journey:**\n- Leo marks a set of buyer FAQs as favorites for quick access. If a question is merged/removed by admin, Leo is notified and the favorite is archived.\n- Mina launches a batch review of sudden favorite increases for a flagged item, with system tools exposing both raw logs and AI anomaly scores.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- A user can add, view, delete, and organize favorites by type and tag; maximums per category are enforced (e.g., 200 products, 20 addresses).\n- Bulk operations: users may batch-add or remove favorites (restricted by quota and rate-limits).\n- AI personalization determines order based on frequency of interaction, recency, inferred interest, and event triggers. For example, if a user repeatedly searches but never purchases, AI might boost that favorite's rank temporarily.\n- API endpoints must validate entity existence; attempting to favorite a missing or restricted item returns a clear error.\n- Favorites must persist across devices; edge case: concurrent device changes must resolve conflicts using latest timestamp.\n- Privacy: only item owners and authorized admins may see a user’s favorites. Sharing options are opt-in and revoke permissions in real-time.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Scalability**: Must handle spikes (10x normal traffic) during events without loss or delay, e.g. Black Friday sales.\n- **Fault Tolerance**: In event of API outage, local UI should show the last synced state with a warning.\n- **Auditability**: All changes to favorites must be logged with before/after states for compliance.\n- **Performance**: Retrieval or update actions should complete within 250ms under peak load; AI re-ranking should not block UI responsiveness.\n- **Security**: All favorite actions require authentication matching user roles; permissions must be strictly enforced.\n\n## High-Level System Flow\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n  A[User Initiates Favorite Action] --> B{Type: Product, Inquiry, etc};\n  B --> C[API Validates Auth & Item Availability];\n  C -->|Valid| D[Add to Favorites];\n  C -->|Invalid/Exception| E[Return Error Message];\n  D --> F[AI Updates Personalized Order];\n  F --> G[Show Updated Favorites];\n  E --> G;\n```\n### Detailed Breakdown and Error Handling:\n1. **User Action**: Initiates favorite/unfavorite from any entry point (card, detail, notification, inquiry thread).\n2. **API Validation**: Checks authentication, quotas, existence, duplication, and privacy settings.\n   - Exception: Favoriting an item that no longer exists triggers a user-facing error and logs an AI learning signal (e.g., update personalization to avoid such items).\n   - Edge Case: Winning a high-volume race between two devices, the system uses latest timestamp; conflicts trigger a reconciliation prompt to user.\n3. **AI Re-Ranking**: After successful add/remove, user’s history (clicks, time spent, seasonal events) is evaluated using a priority matrix and/or decision tree (see below).\n   - Example: Anna's bag receives a promo event signal; AI boosts it, but deprioritizes discontinued items.\n4. **User Notification**: Alerts on failed attempts, batch outcome summaries, and targeted suggestions (e.g., “5 of your favorite shoes are on sale!”)\n5. **Sync and Consistency**: All changes are propagated in near real-time to all logged-in devices; event queues handle peak loads.\n\n#### AI Personalization Logic Example\n- Inputs: Favorited items list, recent views/clicks, purchase history, seasonal context, interaction recency/frequency.\n- Flow (pseudo-code):\n```\nFor each favorite:\n  score = AI_weighted_sum(\n    click_recency,\n    number_of_interactions,\n    purchase_proximity,\n    event_flags (e.g., sale, stock warning),\n    user_profile_signals\n  )\nOrder favorites by descending score.\nBoost if favorite matches: [current promotion OR abandoned cart OR trending search]\nDemote if: [item discontinued OR user recently removed similar items]\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- 100% of favorites operations covered by automated tests: normal, boundary, and exception flows.\n- Edge Cases: Attempting to favorite restricted, non-existent, or removed items generates clear errors and logs events.\n- Personalization tested: At least 90% satisfaction score in post-release A/B testing for AI recommendation

AI Shop Favorites System\n\n[Table of Contents](./00_ai_shop_toc.md)\n\n## Overview\nThe AI Shop Favorites System is engineered to deliver personalized, dynamic management of favorite (bookmarked) items across product, inquiry, address, and notification categories. Leveraging AI algorithms, the system not only hosts traditional favorites operations (add/remove/view) but also intelligently surfaces, organizes, and recommends items based on evolving user preferences and contextual behaviors. This is a cross-module capability, accessible from product listings, detail views, user dashboards, and notification streams, making it a cornerstone for consistent user engagement and retention across device types and roles.\n\n## Objectives\n- Enable one-click addition and removal of favorites for products, inquiries, addresses, and notifications.\n- Provide AI-driven personalized favorites sorting and suggestions based on behavior history, stated interests, and contextual signals (e.g., season, promotions, stock changes).\n- Maintain robustness and clarity across exception cases (e.g., duplicate addition, deleted items, privacy restrictions).\n- Support advanced features such as batch-operations, favoriting limits, and smart folders.\n- Ensure full auditability and compliance with data privacy laws.\n\n## User Personas\n**Customer Persona**: \"Anna, the Variety Shopper\"\n- Anna is an active shopper who loves to explore trending and seasonal products. She frequently bookmarks items to compare, reorder, or watch for future discounts. For Anna, AI-organized favorites prioritize items with upcoming sales, those recently viewed, or ones with low stock.\n- *Scenario*: Anna favorites three handbags, two of which go on sale. The system pushes these products to the top of her favorites, notifying her of discounts. If Anna removes a favorite due to price increase, the AI learns to deprioritize similar items.\n\n**Seller Persona**: \"Leo, the Inventory Optimizer\"\n- Leo, as a seller, uses favorites to monitor competitive products and buyer inquiries. He wants to favorite certain repeat questions for quick response and frequently-watched competitor listings.\n- *Scenario*: Leo bookmarks high-performing competitor sneakers. After a stockout, the system recommends similar sneakers and sends trends based on his favorites.\n\n**Admin Persona**: \"Mina, the Compliance Guardian\"\n- Admins track favorites engagement, monitor for abuse or fraud (e.g., bots mass-favoriting products), and ensure privacy-compliant management.\n- *Scenario*: Mina observes a spike in favorites for a suspicious product, triggers an audit, and the system provides behavioral logs and AI-detected anomalies.\n\n## User Journeys\n**Customer Journey:**\n1. Anna browses bags and clicks “Add to Favorites” on several items. The UI confirms addition; duplicates return an “Already in favorites” toast.\n2. Favorites are grouped (e.g., by type or sale status) and sorted using AI (recent activity, promotions, personalized ranking).\n3. If a favorite is discontinued, Anna receives an alert and the item is moved to an “Unavailable” section.\n4. Anna selects multiple favorites for bulk removal; edge case: attempting to remove items already deleted from catalog prompts a skip/removal notification.\n5. Preference updates, such as a newly set favorite category, dynamically alter future recommendations.\n\n**Seller/Admin Journey:**\n- Leo marks a set of buyer FAQs as favorites for quick access. If a question is merged/removed by admin, Leo is notified and the favorite is archived.\n- Mina launches a batch review of sudden favorite increases for a flagged item, with system tools exposing both raw logs and AI anomaly scores.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- A user can add, view, delete, and organize favorites by type and tag; maximums per category are enforced (e.g., 200 products, 20 addresses).\n- Bulk operations: users may batch-add or remove favorites (restricted by quota and rate-limits).\n- AI personalization determines order based on frequency of interaction, recency, inferred interest, and event triggers. For example, if a user repeatedly searches but never purchases, AI might boost that favorite's rank temporarily.\n- API endpoints must validate entity existence; attempting to favorite a missing or restricted item returns a clear error.\n- Favorites must persist across devices; edge case: concurrent device changes must resolve conflicts using latest timestamp.\n- Privacy: only item owners and authorized admins may see a user’s favorites. Sharing options are opt-in and revoke permissions in real-time.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Scalability**: Must handle spikes (10x normal traffic) during events without loss or delay, e.g. Black Friday sales.\n- **Fault Tolerance**: In event of API outage, local UI should show the last synced state with a warning.\n- **Auditability**: All changes to favorites must be logged with before/after states for compliance.\n- **Performance**: Retrieval or update actions should complete within 250ms under peak load; AI re-ranking should not block UI responsiveness.\n- **Security**: All favorite actions require authentication matching user roles; permissions must be strictly enforced.\n\n## High-Level System Flow\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n  A[User Initiates Favorite Action] --> B{Type: Product, Inquiry, etc};\n  B --> C[API Validates Auth & Item Availability];\n  C -->|Valid| D[Add to Favorites];\n  C -->|Invalid/Exception| E[Return Error Message];\n  D --> F[AI Updates Personalized Order];\n  F --> G[Show Updated Favorites];\n  E --> G;\n```\n### Detailed Breakdown and Error Handling:\n1. **User Action**: Initiates favorite/unfavorite from any entry point (card, detail, notification, inquiry thread).\n2. **API Validation**: Checks authentication, quotas, existence, duplication, and privacy settings.\n   - Exception: Favoriting an item that no longer exists triggers a user-facing error and logs an AI learning signal (e.g., update personalization to avoid such items).\n   - Edge Case: Winning a high-volume race between two devices, the system uses latest timestamp; conflicts trigger a reconciliation prompt to user.\n3. **AI Re-Ranking**: After successful add/remove, user’s history (clicks, time spent, seasonal events) is evaluated using a priority matrix and/or decision tree (see below).\n   - Example: Anna's bag receives a promo event signal; AI boosts it, but deprioritizes discontinued items.\n4. **User Notification**: Alerts on failed attempts, batch outcome summaries, and targeted suggestions (e.g., “5 of your favorite shoes are on sale!”)\n5. **Sync and Consistency**: All changes are propagated in near real-time to all logged-in devices; event queues handle peak loads.\n\n#### AI Personalization Logic Example\n- Inputs: Favorited items list, recent views/clicks, purchase history, seasonal context, interaction recency/frequency.\n- Flow (pseudo-code):\n```\nFor each favorite:\n  score = AI_weighted_sum(\n    click_recency,\n    number_of_interactions,\n    purchase_proximity,\n    event_flags (e.g., sale, stock warning),\n    user_profile_signals\n  )\nOrder favorites by descending score.\nBoost if favorite matches: [current promotion OR abandoned cart OR trending search]\nDemote if: [item discontinued OR user recently removed similar items]\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- 100% of favorites operations covered by automated tests: normal, boundary, and exception flows.\n- Edge Cases: Attempting to favorite restricted, non-existent, or removed items generates clear errors and logs events.\n- Personalization tested: At least 90% satisfaction score in post-release A/B testing for AI recommendation accuracy.\n- All user actions yield appropriate visual feedback in all supported languages.\n- Audit logs: Any admin investigation can reconstruct event chronology for regulatory review.\n\n## References\n- [Table of Contents](./00_ai_shop_toc.md)\n- [System Architecture & Compliance](./11_ai_shop_system_architecture_and_compliance.md)\n"},"review":"The document \"10_ai_shop_favorites_system.md\" is thorough, well-structured, and covers the AI Shop Favorites System extensively.

AI Shop Favorites System\n\n[Table of Contents](./00_ai_shop_toc.md)\n\n## Overview\nThe AI Shop Favorites System is engineered to deliver personalized, dynamic management of favorite (bookmarked) items across product, inquiry, address, and notification categories. Leveraging AI algorithms, the system not only hosts traditional favorites operations (add/remove/view) but also intelligently surfaces, organizes, and recommends items based on evolving user preferences and contextual behaviors. This is a cross-module capability, accessible from product listings, detail views, user dashboards, and notification streams, making it a cornerstone for consistent user engagement and retention across device types and roles.\n\n## Objectives\n- Enable one-click addition and removal of favorites for products, inquiries, addresses, and notifications.\n- Provide AI-driven personalized favorites sorting and suggestions based on behavior history, stated interests, and contextual signals (e.g., season, promotions, stock changes).\n- Maintain robustness and clarity across exception cases (e.g., duplicate addition, deleted items, privacy restrictions).\n- Support advanced features such as batch-operations, favoriting limits, and smart folders.\n- Ensure full auditability and compliance with data privacy laws.\n\n## User Personas\n**Customer Persona**: \"Anna, the Variety Shopper\"\n- Anna is an active shopper who loves to explore trending and seasonal products. She frequently bookmarks items to compare, reorder, or watch for future discounts. For Anna, AI-organized favorites prioritize items with upcoming sales, those recently viewed, or ones with low stock.\n- *Scenario*: Anna favorites three handbags, two of which go on sale. The system pushes these products to the top of her favorites, notifying her of discounts. If Anna removes a favorite due to price increase, the AI learns to deprioritize similar items.\n\n**Seller Persona**: \"Leo, the Inventory Optimizer\"\n- Leo, as a seller, uses favorites to monitor competitive products and buyer inquiries. He wants to favorite certain repeat questions for quick response and frequently-watched competitor listings.\n- *Scenario*: Leo bookmarks high-performing competitor sneakers. After a stockout, the system recommends similar sneakers and sends trends based on his favorites.\n\n**Admin Persona**: \"Mina, the Compliance Guardian\"\n- Admins track favorites engagement, monitor for abuse or fraud (e.g., bots mass-favoriting products), and ensure privacy-compliant management.\n- *Scenario*: Mina observes a spike in favorites for a suspicious product, triggers an audit, and the system provides behavioral logs and AI-detected anomalies.\n\n## User Journeys\n**Customer Journey:**\n1. Anna browses bags and clicks “Add to Favorites” on several items. The UI confirms addition; duplicates return an “Already in favorites” toast.\n2. Favorites are grouped (e.g., by type or sale status) and sorted using AI (recent activity, promotions, personalized ranking).\n3. If a favorite is discontinued, Anna receives an alert and the item is moved to an “Unavailable” section.\n4. Anna selects multiple favorites for bulk removal; edge case: attempting to remove items already deleted from catalog prompts a skip/removal notification.\n5. Preference updates, such as a newly set favorite category, dynamically alter future recommendations.\n\n**Seller/Admin Journey:**\n- Leo marks a set of buyer FAQs as favorites for quick access. If a question is merged/removed by admin, Leo is notified and the favorite is archived.\n- Mina launches a batch review of sudden favorite increases for a flagged item, with system tools exposing both raw logs and AI anomaly scores.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- A user can add, view, delete, and organize favorites by type and tag; maximums per category are enforced (e.g., 200 products, 20 addresses).\n- Bulk operations: users may batch-add or remove favorites (restricted by quota and rate-limits).\n- AI personalization determines order based on frequency of interaction, recency, inferred interest, and event triggers. For example, if a user repeatedly searches but never purchases, AI might boost that favorite's rank temporarily.\n- API endpoints must validate entity existence; attempting to favorite a missing or restricted item returns a clear error.\n- Favorites must persist across devices; edge case: concurrent device changes must resolve conflicts using latest timestamp.\n- Privacy: only item owners and authorized admins may see a user’s favorites. Sharing options are opt-in and revoke permissions in real-time.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Scalability**: Must handle spikes (10x normal traffic) during events without loss or delay, e.g. Black Friday sales.\n- **Fault Tolerance**: In event of API outage, local UI should show the last synced state with a warning.\n- **Auditability**: All changes to favorites must be logged with before/after states for compliance.\n- **Performance**: Retrieval or update actions should complete within 250ms under peak load; AI re-ranking should not block UI responsiveness.\n- **Security**: All favorite actions require authentication matching user roles; permissions must be strictly enforced.\n\n## High-Level System Flow\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n  A[User Initiates Favorite Action] --> B{Type: Product, Inquiry, etc};\n  B --> C[API Validates Auth & Item Availability];\n  C -->|Valid| D[Add to Favorites];\n  C -->|Invalid/Exception| E[Return Error Message];\n  D --> F[AI Updates Personalized Order];\n  F --> G[Show Updated Favorites];\n  E --> G;\n```\n### Detailed Breakdown and Error Handling:\n1. **User Action**: Initiates favorite/unfavorite from any entry point (card, detail, notification, inquiry thread).\n2. **API Validation**: Checks authentication, quotas, existence, duplication, and privacy settings.\n   - Exception: Favoriting an item that no longer exists triggers a user-facing error and logs an AI learning signal (e.g., update personalization to avoid such items).\n   - Edge Case: Winning a high-volume race between two devices, the system uses latest timestamp; conflicts trigger a reconciliation prompt to user.\n3. **AI Re-Ranking**: After successful add/remove, user’s history (clicks, time spent, seasonal events) is evaluated using a priority matrix and/or decision tree (see below).\n   - Example: Anna's bag receives a promo event signal; AI boosts it, but deprioritizes discontinued items.\n4. **User Notification**: Alerts on failed attempts, batch outcome summaries, and targeted suggestions (e.g., “5 of your favorite shoes are on sale!”)\n5. **Sync and Consistency**: All changes are propagated in near real-time to all logged-in devices; event queues handle peak loads.\n\n#### AI Personalization Logic Example\n- Inputs: Favorited items list, recent views/clicks, purchase history, seasonal context, interaction recency/frequency.\n- Flow (pseudo-code):\n```\nFor each favorite:\n  score = AI_weighted_sum(\n    click_recency,\n    number_of_interactions,\n    purchase_proximity,\n    event_flags (e.g., sale, stock warning),\n    user_profile_signals\n  )\nOrder favorites by descending score.\nBoost if favorite matches: [current promotion OR abandoned cart OR trending search]\nDemote if: [item discontinued OR user recently removed similar items]\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- 100% of favorites operations covered by automated tests: normal, boundary, and exception flows.\n- Edge Cases: Attempting to favorite restricted, non-existent, or removed items generates clear errors and logs events.\n- Personalization tested: At least 90% satisfaction score in post-release A/B testing for AI recommendation accuracy.\n- All user actions yield appropriate visual feedback in all supported languages.\n- Audit logs: Any admin investigation can reconstruct event chronology for regulatory review.\n\n##

Leveraging AI algorithms, the system not only hosts traditional favorites operations (add/remove/view) but also intelligently surfaces, organizes, and recommends items based on evolving user preferences and contextual behaviors. This is a cross-module capability, accessible from product listings, detail views, user dashboards, and notification streams, making it a cornerstone for consistent user engagement and retention across device types and roles.\n\n## Objectives\n- Enable one-click addition and removal of favorites for products, inquiries, addresses, and notifications.\n- Provide AI-driven personalized favorites sorting and suggestions based on behavior history, stated interests, and contextual signals (e.g., season, promotions, stock changes).\n- Maintain robustness and clarity across exception cases (e.g., duplicate addition, deleted items, privacy restrictions).\n- Support advanced features such as batch-operations, favoriting limits, and smart folders.\n- Ensure full auditability and compliance with data privacy laws.\n\n## User Personas\n**Customer Persona**: \"Anna, the Variety Shopper\"\n- Anna is an active shopper who loves to explore trending and seasonal products. She frequently bookmarks items to compare, reorder, or watch for future discounts. For Anna, AI-organized favorites prioritize items with upcoming sales, those recently viewed, or ones with low stock.\n- *Scenario*: Anna favorites three handbags, two of which go on sale. The system pushes these products to the top of her favorites, notifying her of discounts. If Anna removes a favorite due to price increase, the AI learns to deprioritize similar items.\n\n**Seller Persona**: \"Leo, the Inventory Optimizer\"\n- Leo, as a seller, uses favorites to monitor competitive products and buyer inquiries. He wants to favorite certain repeat questions for quick response and frequently-watched competitor listings.\n- *Scenario*: Leo bookmarks high-performing competitor sneakers. After a stockout, the system recommends similar sneakers and sends trends based on his favorites.\n\n**Admin Persona**: \"Mina, the Compliance Guardian\"\n- Admins track favorites engagement, monitor for abuse or fraud (e.g., bots mass-favoriting products), and ensure privacy-compliant management.\n- *Scenario*: Mina observes a spike in favorites for a suspicious product, triggers an audit, and the system provides behavioral logs and AI-detected anomalies.\n\n## User Journeys\n**Customer Journey:**\n1. Anna browses bags and clicks “Add to Favorites” on several items. The UI confirms addition; duplicates return an “Already in favorites” toast.\n2. Favorites are grouped (e.g., by type or sale status) and sorted using AI (recent activity, promotions, personalized ranking).\n3. If a favorite is discontinued, Anna receives an alert and the item is moved to an “Unavailable” section.\n4. Anna selects multiple favorites for bulk removal; edge case: attempting to remove items already deleted from catalog prompts a skip/removal notification.\n5. Preference updates, such as a newly set favorite category, dynamically alter future recommendations.\n\n**Seller/Admin Journey:**\n- Leo marks a set of buyer FAQs as favorites for quick access. If a question is merged/removed by admin, Leo is notified and the favorite is archived.\n- Mina launches a batch review of sudden favorite increases for a flagged item, with system tools exposing both raw logs and AI anomaly scores.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- A user can add, view, delete, and organize favorites by type and tag; maximums per category are enforced (e.g., 200 products, 20 addresses).\n- Bulk operations: users may batch-add or remove favorites (restricted by quota and rate-limits).\n- AI personalization determines order based on frequency of interaction, recency, inferred interest, and event triggers. For example, if a user repeatedly searches but never purchases, AI might boost that favorite's rank temporarily.\n- API endpoints must validate entity existence; attempting to favorite a missing or restricted item returns a clear error.\n- Favorites must persist across devices; edge case: concurrent device changes must resolve conflicts using latest timestamp.\n- Privacy: only item owners and authorized admins may see a user’s favorites. Sharing options are opt-in and revoke permissions in real-time.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Scalability**: Must handle spikes (10x normal traffic) during events without loss or delay, e.g. Black Friday sales.\n- **Fault Tolerance**: In event of API outage, local UI should show the last synced state with a warning.\n- **Auditability**: All changes to favorites must be logged with before/after states for compliance.\n- **Performance**: Retrieval or update actions should complete within 250ms under peak load; AI re-ranking should not block UI responsiveness.\n- **Security**: All favorite actions require authentication matching user roles; permissions must be strictly enforced.\n\n## High-Level System Flow\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n  A[User Initiates Favorite Action] --> B{Type: Product, Inquiry, etc};\n  B --> C[API Validates Auth & Item Availability];\n  C -->|Valid| D[Add to Favorites];\n  C -->|Invalid/Exception| E[Return Error Message];\n  D --> F[AI Updates Personalized Order];\n  F --> G[Show Updated Favorites];\n  E --> G;\n```\n### Detailed Breakdown and Error Handling:\n1. **User Action**: Initiates favorite/unfavorite from any entry point (card, detail, notification, inquiry thread).\n2. **API Validation**: Checks authentication, quotas, existence, duplication, and privacy settings.\n   - Exception: Favoriting an item that no longer exists triggers a user-facing error and logs an AI learning signal (e.g., update personalization to avoid such items).\n   - Edge Case: Winning a high-volume race between two devices, the system uses latest timestamp; conflicts trigger a reconciliation prompt to user.\n3. **AI Re-Ranking**: After successful add/remove, user’s history (clicks, time spent, seasonal events) is evaluated using a priority matrix and/or decision tree (see below).\n   - Example: Anna's bag receives a promo event signal; AI boosts it, but deprioritizes discontinued items.\n4. **User Notification**: Alerts on failed attempts, batch outcome summaries, and targeted suggestions (e.g., “5 of your favorite shoes are on sale!”)\n5. **Sync and Consistency**: All changes are propagated in near real-time to all logged-in devices; event queues handle peak loads.\n\n#### AI Personalization Logic Example\n- Inputs: Favorited items list, recent views/clicks, purchase history, seasonal context, interaction recency/frequency.\n- Flow (pseudo-code):\n```\nFor each favorite:\n  score = AI_weighted_sum(\n    click_recency,\n    number_of_interactions,\n    purchase_proximity,\n    event_flags (e.g., sale, stock warning),\n    user_profile_signals\n  )\nOrder favorites by descending score.\nBoost if favorite matches: [current promotion OR abandoned cart OR trending search]\nDemote if: [item discontinued OR user recently removed similar items]\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- 100% of favorites operations covered by automated tests: normal, boundary, and exception flows.\n- Edge Cases: Attempting to favorite restricted, non-existent, or removed items generates clear errors and logs events.\n- Personalization tested: At least 90% satisfaction score in post-release A/B testing for AI recommendation accuracy.\n- All user actions yield appropriate visual feedback in all supported languages.\n- Audit logs: Any admin investigation can reconstruct event chronology for regulatory review.\n\n## References\n- [Table of Contents](./00_ai_shop_toc.md)\n- [System Architecture & Compliance](./11_ai_shop_system_architecture_and_compliance.md)\n","11_ai_shop_system_architecture_and_compliance.md":"# AI Shop System Architecture and Compliance\n\n## 1.
