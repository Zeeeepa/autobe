Overview\nThe User and Identity Management system for the AI Shopmall establishes secure, scalable, and user-friendly foundations for all authentication and authorization flows. It defines how customers, sellers, and administrators register, log in, manage their roles, and interact securely with the platform while supporting both traditional and modern (guest, OAuth) authentication methods.\n\n## 2. Objectives\n- Ensure robust and secure identity and access management for all user types\n- Provide seamless and flexible registration/login options, including external OAuth\n- Support role-based permissions and dynamic role escalation/approval flows\n- Centralize user profile and identity data for compliance and personalization\n\n## 3. User Roles\n| Role          | Description                                                                                                                   | Key Permissions                                              |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Customer      | Shopper who browses, purchases, earns rewards, and manages favorites/profile                                                  | Browse, purchase, review, favorite, profile mgmt             |\n| Seller        | Member who lists products, manages inventory, reviews sales analytics, and responds to queries (approval required)            | Product/inventory mgmt, view analytics, reply to customers   |\n| Administrator | Privileged user managing backend, users, products, compliance, analytics, and all system settings                             | All permissions (admin UI, config, compliance, auditing)     |\n\nThe system enforces clear separation between these roles using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). All APIs are protected by relevant role checks.\n\n## 4. User Registration and Login Flows\n**Supported authentication methods:**\n- Standard email/password registration and login\n- Guest access with temporary session profiles\n- External OAuth (Google, Apple, Kakao, Naver, etc.)\n\nAuthentication journey:\n1. **Registration**: Users can sign up (customer/seller) via email or OAuth; sellers require approval by admin before activation.\n2. **Login**: Users authenticate via their chosen method. Session tokens maintain secure state.\n3. **Role Assignment & Escalation**: Upon login, the backend loads role claims for each user and applies authorization gates accordingly. Seller role changes require audit/approval flow.\n\n### Mermaid Diagram: Login & Registration Flow (Summary)\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n  A[Start] --> B{Choose Login Method}\n  B -->|Email/Password| C[Enter credentials]\n  B -->|OAuth| D[Select OAuth Provider]\n  C --> E[Verify/2FA (opt)]\n  D --> E\n  E --> F{Role Type}\n  F -->|Customer| G[Load Customer Dashboard]\n  F -->|Seller| H{Approval Status}\n  H -->|Approved| I[Load Seller Portal]\n  H -->|Pending| J[Show Pending Notice]\n  F -->|Admin| K[Admin Console]\n```\n\n## 5. User Profile Management\n- Users access self-service portal to edit personal details, change passwords, manage connected accounts, and revoke sessions.\n- Profile contains display name, contact info, addresses, avatar, linked OAuth accounts, and preferences. Sensitive actions require re-authentication.\n\n## 6. Security and Compliance\n- All passwords securely hashed (bcrypt or better)\n- MFA/2FA available for all users (recommended, required for sellers/admins)\n- Access tokens are short-lived; refresh token rotation applied\n- Strict audit logging for role changes, admin operations, sensitive actions\n- GDPR/CCPA compliant consent, data deletion, and export tools integrated\n\n## 7. Role-Based Access Design\n- Each REST API endpoint enforces role-based authorization:\n    - Customers: Purchase, rewards, favorites, orders, personal info (scoped)\n    - Sellers: Product, inventory, analytics, and customer messaging (limited to their catalog)\n    - Administrators: Full management (system-wide)\n- APIs issue JWTs with role and scope claims per session.\n\n## 8. Acceptance Criteria\n- Users can register, upgrade, or revoke their role securely and smoothly\n- All user data updates/operations are logged and auditable\n- Role-restricted endpoints cannot be accessed by unauthorized users\n- Seamless OAuth integration & SSO for all supported providers\n- Compliance and data portability requirements are met\n\n---\n\n[Return to Table of Contents](./00_ai_shopmall_toc.md)\n","03_ai_shopmall_product_and_inventory_management.md":"# AI Shopmall – Product & Inventory Management\n\n---\n\n## 1.

It manages every phase from product selection through checkout, payment processing, shipment, returns, cancellations, and aftersales—while tightly integrated with user/identity, product/inventory, and promotions systems. This document serves as an actionable specification for developers, outlining flows, data models, real-world cases, and relationships with adjacent systems.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- **Cart Management**: Support add/update/delete for single/multiple SKUs, with real-time inventory validation, merging duplicate entries, handling limits (max per order, item, user). Edge cases include out-of-stock changes during shopping and price updates. Error scenarios: stockout at checkout, price changed after carted, exceeding available promo/redemption limits.\n   - Flow: On add-to-cart, system checks [product & inventory] (via `/inventory/check`) for quantity, price, and promotion eligibility, then updates session/user cart. If inventory depletes before checkout, cart shows warning and disables checkout button for that SKU. Example API call: `POST /cart/add {skuId, quantity, userId}`. Response includes updated cart state and warnings if any.\n\n- **Order Placement**: Enables one-click or multi-step checkout, supporting split orders by seller/warehouse, multi-shipping, and address validation. Edge: multi-seller split, different delivery schedules. Error: Address outside delivery area, payment failure, insufficient user role.\n   - Flow: User proceeds to checkout, system locks cart items (invoking `/inventory/lock`). Orders are split per seller for fulfillment, tracking per seller’s SLA. Example: `POST /order/checkout {cartId, addressId, paymentToken}`. State: pending → paid/failed. Errors are returned with failure codes (`OUT_OF_STOCK`, `INVALID_ADDRESS`).\n\n- **Payment Integration**: Connect with payment gateways (cards, wallets, points, rewards). Rollback cart/order on payment failure. Edge: guest checkout with limited payment methods. Includes secure handling of sensitive info.\n   - Pattern: `POST /payment/authorize {orderId, paymentMethod, userId}` → On success, triggers order confirmation, else emits payment error with guidance for next steps.\n\n- **Order Fulfillment & Logistics**: Coordinate with logistics partners (internal/third-party) for each order split, providing tracking, shipping updates, and estimated delivery. Errors: delayed handoff, lost item, nondelivery.\n   - API: `GET /order/status {orderId}` returns current state, per-item tracking number. State updates are pushed to customer and admin dashboards.\n\n- **Returns & Aftersales**: Allow returns, exchanges, or order cancellations before dispatch, handling both auto-approval (by rule) and manual review (operator). Includes fraud checks and auto-reversal of inventory and payment where valid.\n   - Scenario: User requests refund for partial item delivery. System verifies eligibility by status and rules, initiates payment reversal, and updates inventory.\n\n- **Notifications**: Real-time status updates (cart, order, shipment) via email/SMS/push, handled by messaging queue and user preferences.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Performance**: <300ms for key flows (add-to-cart, checkout, order query), aiming for 99.99% uptime. Scalability via stateless APIs, asynchronous job queues for fulfillment events, and hypermedia for order navigation.\n  - *Implementation*: Use CDN for static assets, cache inventory checks, autoscale service pools.\n\n- **Reliability**: ACID compliance on order/payment, distributed transaction management for split/rollback operations. SLAs: 99.99% order integrity, auto alert for failed jobs.\n\n- **Security**: PCI DSS for payment, GDPR compliant on PII, access scoped by user role. Implement rate limiting, anti-fraud, input sanitization.\n\n- **Traceability**: Full audit logs for every cart/order change, searchable by user, item, and timestamp. *Mitigation*: All events signed and timestamped.\n\n- **Testability**: Contract and end-to-end tests automated for each stage—cart, order, payment, fulfillment runs. Include mocks for third-party failures (payment, shipping).\n\n## Relationships to Other Systems\n### Product & Inventory Management ([see details](./03_ai_shopmall_product_and_inventory_management.md))\nThis system interfaces during add-to-cart (inventory, SKU/option mapping), price/finality-lock at checkout, and fulfillment (reserved stock release/conflict resolution). Models include `SKU`, `StockItem` (fields: `id`, `skuId`, `quantity`, `location`, `reservedForOrderId`). Errors include over-reservation (race), stale stock, and system sync failures. All adjustments are idempotent and audit-logged.\n\n### Promotion & Rewards System ([see details](./05_ai_shopmall_promotion_and_rewards_system.md))\nCart and order modules query/apply available promotions per line item or order (coupons, rewards, bundle discounts). Decision logic runs: eligibility (time, user role, inventory), stacking order, and best-benefit computation. On order update/cancel, reverses/adjusts applied promos. Conflict: mutually exclusive offers. Flow: `POST /promotion/apply {cartId, userId}` returns promo deductions, warnings, and affected items.\n\n### User & Identity Management ([see details](./02_ai_shopmall_user_and_identity_management.md))\nAll mutation APIs (cart/order/returns) require authentication scoped by `customer`, `seller`, or `admin` roles. Supports guest checkout (limited features: single-shipment, excludes rewards). Handles fraud/fake-user detection with CAPTCHA, device/fingerprint checks, and transaction velocity rules. Permission failures: API returns `401/403` with audit trail. Users can upgrade account or switch to full registration mid-flow.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Successful add-to-cart for in-stock and permitted SKUs, with error messages for out-of-stock, exceeding limits, and price/promo changes. Automated QA simulates concurrent adds and inventory race conditions.\n- Checkout flow supports split orders, promo application, address validation, and payment success/failure. Tests run for every combination of guest/registered, multiple addresses, and payment fallback cases.\n- Payment completion triggers fulfillment. Negative test: simulate gateway timeout or fraud rejection and check for order compensation.\n- Audit logs capture all changes, accessible and filterable for admins.\n- Order, cart, and fulfillment models and APIs covered by contract and end-to-end tests, with mocks for upstream (inventory, payment, shipping) failures.\n\n## Practical Examples & Flows\n- **Cart Add Example**:\n   - Request: `POST /cart/add {skuId: \"S901\", quantity: 2, userId: \"U123\"}`\n   - System: Validates inventory using `/inventory/check`, applies eligible promotions, and updates cart state.\n   - Response: `{cartId: \"C125\", items: [...], message: \"2 items added. Promotion X applied. Remaining stock: 18.\"}`\n   - Edge: If SKU is OOS, returns `{error: \"OUT_OF_STOCK\"}`\n\n- **Order Checkout Example**:\n   - Request: `POST /order/checkout {cartId, shipping: {...}, paymentToken}`\n   - Flow: System locks inventory, splits order per seller, validates promo, and initiates payment auth. On success, triggers fulfillment; on failure, rolls inventory/promo and returns error.\n\n- **Promo Application Example**:\n   - User applies coupon at checkout. System calls `/promotion/apply`, recalculates total, reverses promo if cart changes, resolves conflicts by business rules (e.g., best discount wins), and logs user/rule/decision.\n   \n---","05_ai_shopmall_promotion_and_rewards_system.md":"# Promotion and Rewards System Plan\n\n## 1.

Core features include managing favorites across products, addresses, and inquiries, tailoring notifications, and leveraging folders and tags for organization. Advanced personalization is achieved by learning user patterns and suggesting relevant content or promotions.\n\n---\n\n## Objectives\n- Increase user engagement and retention by offering customizable favorites and recommendations.\n- Streamline shopping experiences and repeat purchases.\n- Provide scalable personalization that adapts to various entity types (products, sellers, inquiries, addresses).\n\n---\n\n## User Journeys\n### Scenario 1: Adding and Removing a Favorite (Positive/Negative)\n- **Customer views a product:** The \"Add to Favorites\" button is displayed.\n    - **Step 1:** User taps the button. Confirmation appears, and the product is added to their default favorites folder.\n    - **Step 2:** User receives an optional prompt to categorize the favorite into a custom folder or add tags.\n    - **Negative Path 1:** If not logged in, the system prompts the user to log in or sign up before saving the favorite, with clear error messaging.\n    - **Negative Path 2:** If the favorite already exists in the chosen folder, a non-intrusive message advises the user.\n- **Removing a favorite:**\n    - **Step 1:** User clicks the “Remove from Favorites” icon beside a saved item.\n    - **Step 2:** The item is instantly removed, providing undo feedback.\n    - **Negative Path:** If the item was not found (sync issue), an error message is shown with troubleshooting advice.\n\n### Scenario 2: Notification Preferences (Positive/Negative)\n- **User opens notification settings:** A list of favorite-linked alerts (e.g., price drop, restock, product review response) is displayed.\n    - **Step 1:** User toggles notification types (push, email, SMS).\n    - **Step 2:** User chooses to mute notifications for specific folders.\n    - **Negative Path:** If the system fails to update preferences (connectivity, error), the UI notifies and reverts changes.\n    - **Opt-out case:** User declines all notifications; system respects and confirms their selection.\n\n### Scenario 3: Organizing Favorites in Folders\n- **Step 1:** User creates, renames, or deletes folders.\n- **Step 2:** Favorites are moved between folders by drag-and-drop or bulk selection.\n- **Negative Path:** Trying to delete a folder containing favorites prompts for confirmation; deletion only proceeds if the user selects to either move or delete the contained entries.\n\n---\n\n## Functional Requirements (with examples)\n1. **Add/Remove Favorites**\n    - Users may add any supported entity (product, seller, address, inquiry) to favorites.\n    - Example: Add product #1001 to \"Spring Sale\" folder, tag as \"Gift Idea.\"\n    - Edge: Prevent duplicate entries within the same folder and type.\n2. **Folder & Tag Management**\n    - Users create, rename, or delete folders.\n    - Favorites can be tagged for fast filtering: “Organic”, “Wishlist”, etc.\n    - Example: Move two addresses to \"Holiday List.\"\n3. **Notification Preferences**\n    - Users toggle notification types (push/email/SMS) per favorite or folder.\n    - Muting notifications per item/folder is supported.\n    - Example: Enable push for price drops in “Wishlist”; mute notifications entirely for \"Work Supplies.\"\n4. **Multi-entity Support**\n    - Supported entities: products, sellers, addresses, inquiries (all with unique IDs).\n    - Flows are similar regardless of entity, but metadata varies (e.g., address notes vs. product specs).\n5. **Bulk Actions**\n    - Select multiple entries to move, tag, or delete in a single operation.\n    - Example: Bulk-remove 10 old favorites.\n\n---\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Security**\n    - Favorites data is encrypted at rest and in transit (AES-256/TLS 1.3+).\n    - Role-based access ensures users manage only their own favorites.\n    - GDPR compliance: Favorite lists and logs exportable as downloadable files; users can request deletion per GDPR \"right to be forgotten.\"\n- **Performance**\n    - All actions complete in <500ms for up to 5,000 favorites per user.\n- **Reliability**\n    - Bulk operations are transactional: partial failures auto-rollback.\n- **Logging & Audit**\n    - All access/changes logged with user ID, timestamp, IP.\n    - Unauthorized or failed attempts are monitored and audited.\n\n---\n\n## Data Model & ERD\n### Entities\n- **User** (`user_id`): Owner of favorites and folders.\n- **Favorite** (`favorite_id`, `entity_type`, `entity_id`, `folder_id`, `user_id`, `tags`, `created_at`): Maps user to item or entity.\n- **Folder** (`folder_id`, `user_id`, `name`): Used to group favorites; can be default or user-created.\n- **NotificationPreference** (`preference_id`, `user_id`, `target_id`, `target_type`, `notif_types_enabled`): Stores delivery types and scope (item/folder/all).\n\n### Relationships\n- One user has multiple folders; each folder is unique per user.\n- One favorite belongs to one folder but can carry multiple tags.\n- Notification preferences can be scoped to either favorite or folder (distinguished by `target_type`).\n\n### Sample Data Table\n| user_id | favorite_id | entity_type | entity_id | folder_id | tags        | created_at           |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------------------|\n| 55      | 101         | product     | 1001      | 900       | \"gift, eco\" | 2025-07-21T10:05:00Z |\n| 55      | 102         | address     | 458       | 901       | \"home\"      | 2025-07-21T13:22:00Z |\n\n### ERD (Mermaid)\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n    USER ||--o{ FOLDER : owns\n    USER ||--o{ NOTIFICATIONPREFERENCE : \"sets\"\n    FOLDER ||--o{ FAVORITE : holds\n    FAVORITE }o--|| NOTIFICATIONPREFERENCE : \"triggers\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria (including edge cases)\n- ✅ User can add/remove any supported entity to favorites when logged in.\n- ✅ User cannot favorite or organize items if not logged in (system prompts for login).\n- ✅ No duplicate favorites within same folder/entity.\n- ✅ User can decline or customize notifications for any favorite or folder.\n- ✅ Attempting to remove a non-existent or already-removed favorite returns a user-visible error.\n- ✅ Folders cannot be deleted if containing favorites without explicit user confirmation.\n- ✅ Favorites data remains private per user; unauthorized access attempts are denied and logged.\n- ✅ Bulk actions properly handle partial errors with rollback and messaging.\n- ✅ GDPR requests for data access/export or erasure are fulfilled within 30 days.\n- ✅ Notifications are not sent more than once per state change (e.g., avoid duplicate alerts).\n- ✅ Role permissions: only the owning user and admins (when permitted) may view or manage a user’s favorites.\n","09_ai_shopmall_extensibility_and_system_structure.md":"# AI Shopmall Extensibility & System Structure\n\n## Overview\nThe AI Shopmall platform is designed as a modular, scalable, and highly extensible commerce solution. This document outlines the core extensibility strategies, section and channel structures, attachment/file management, and system architecture patterns. It is intended to guide ongoing system enhancements and seamless third-party integrations while maintaining robust performance and security.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Extensibility Principles\n- **API-First Orientation:** The Shopmall exposes functionality via secure RESTful APIs and offers GraphQL endpoints for advanced integrations. All core modules (users, inventory, order, content) are accessible and extensible.\n- **Plugin/Module Architecture:** The core system supports dynamic loading of feature modules (e.g., payment gateways, analytics, AI-recommendation widgets) with defined extension points.\n- **Channel & Sectionization:** Business logic and UI/UX can be partitioned into channels (e.g., web, mobile, in-store kiosk) and functional sections (e.g., product list, cart, admin). Each channel/section can override or extend base behaviors with minimal coupling.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Integration Model\n- **Third-Party Apps and APIs:**\n  - OAuth 2.0 with granular scopes for secure external access\n  - Webhooks for event-driven integration (e.g., order/payment/shipment notifications)\n  - API rate limiting & throttling to ensure platform stability\n- **Attachment & File Handling:**\n  - Secure upload/download APIs for product images, manuals, reviews\n  - Role-based access: customers, sellers, and admins each have scoped file privileges\n  - Version control for attachments to prevent stale assets\n\n---\n\n## 3. Performance & Scalability\n- **Horizontal Scaling:** Stateless service design combined with distributed queue systems enables scaling across multiple nodes and regions.\n- **Caching Strategies:** Multi-layered cache (in-memory, distributed) for public sections, with cache invalidation hooks on product/update triggers.\n- **Asynchronous Processing:** Heavy tasks (bulk imports, image processing, analytics) are offloaded to task queues and processed asynchronously.\n- **Monitoring & Auto-Healing:** Integration with real-time monitoring (APM, logs, alerts) and auto-recovery mechanisms minimize downtime.\n\n---\n\n## 4. System Structure Diagram\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Web/Mobile/Kiosk Channels] -->|API Calls| B{API Gateway}\n    B --> C[Core Shopmall Services]\n    C --> D1[User Module]\n    C --> D2[Inventory Module]\n    C --> D3[Order & Cart Module]\n    C --> D4[Content & Review Module]\n    C --> E[Plugin/Extension Loader]\n    E --> F1[3rd-Party Apps]\n    E --> F2[Custom Widgets]\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Extensibility Roadmap & Guidelines\n- **Future-Proofing:** All new APIs and extension points must be backward compatible and strictly versioned\n- **Documentation:** Public and internal interfaces are documented with OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas and kept up-to-date\n- **Security:** All extensibility mechanisms (plugins, APIs, files) undergo regular security audits and enforce principle of least privilege.\n\n---\n\n## References\n- [01_ai_shopmall_system_overview.md](./01_ai_shopmall_system_overview.md)\n- [03_ai_shopmall_product_and_inventory_management.md](./03_ai_shopmall_product_and_inventory_management.md)\n- [10_ai_shopmall_rules_security_and_compliance.md](./10_ai_shopmall_rules_security_and_compliance.md)\n","10_ai_shopmall_rules_security_and_compliance.md":"# AI Shopmall Rules, Security, and Compliance\n\n## Overview\nThis document defines the business rules, regulatory requirements, security standards, data privacy obligations, accessibility guidelines, and audit procedures for the AI Shopmall platform.

AI Shopmall Extensibility & System Structure\n\n## Overview\nThe AI Shopmall platform is designed as a modular, scalable, and highly extensible commerce solution. This document outlines the core extensibility strategies, section and channel structures, attachment/file management, and system architecture patterns. It is intended to guide ongoing system enhancements and seamless third-party integrations while maintaining robust performance and security.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Extensibility Principles\n- **API-First Orientation:** The Shopmall exposes functionality via secure RESTful APIs and offers GraphQL endpoints for advanced integrations. All core modules (users, inventory, order, content) are accessible and extensible.\n- **Plugin/Module Architecture:** The core system supports dynamic loading of feature modules (e.g., payment gateways, analytics, AI-recommendation widgets) with defined extension points.\n- **Channel & Sectionization:** Business logic and UI/UX can be partitioned into channels (e.g., web, mobile, in-store kiosk) and functional sections (e.g., product list, cart, admin). Each channel/section can override or extend base behaviors with minimal coupling.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Integration Model\n- **Third-Party Apps and APIs:**\n  - OAuth 2.0 with granular scopes for secure external access\n  - Webhooks for event-driven integration (e.g., order/payment/shipment notifications)\n  - API rate limiting & throttling to ensure platform stability\n- **Attachment & File Handling:**\n  - Secure upload/download APIs for product images, manuals, reviews\n  - Role-based access: customers, sellers, and admins each have scoped file privileges\n  - Version control for attachments to prevent stale assets\n\n---\n\n## 3. Performance & Scalability\n- **Horizontal Scaling:** Stateless service design combined with distributed queue systems enables scaling across multiple nodes and regions.\n- **Caching Strategies:** Multi-layered cache (in-memory, distributed) for public sections, with cache invalidation hooks on product/update triggers.\n- **Asynchronous Processing:** Heavy tasks (bulk imports, image processing, analytics) are offloaded to task queues and processed asynchronously.\n- **Monitoring & Auto-Healing:** Integration with real-time monitoring (APM, logs, alerts) and auto-recovery mechanisms minimize downtime.\n\n---\n\n## 4. System Structure Diagram\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Web/Mobile/Kiosk Channels] -->|API Calls| B{API Gateway}\n    B --> C[Core Shopmall Services]\n    C --> D1[User Module]\n    C --> D2[Inventory Module]\n    C --> D3[Order & Cart Module]\n    C --> D4[Content & Review Module]\n    C --> E[Plugin/Extension Loader]\n    E --> F1[3rd-Party Apps]\n    E --> F2[Custom Widgets]\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Extensibility Roadmap & Guidelines\n- **Future-Proofing:** All new APIs and extension points must be backward compatible and strictly versioned\n- **Documentation:** Public and internal interfaces are documented with OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas and kept up-to-date\n- **Security:** All extensibility mechanisms (plugins, APIs, files) undergo regular security audits and enforce principle of least privilege.\n\n---\n\n## References\n- [01_ai_shopmall_system_overview.md](./01_ai_shopmall_system_overview.md)\n-

Overview\nThe User and Identity Management system for the AI Shopmall establishes secure, scalable, and user-friendly foundations for all authentication and authorization flows. It defines how customers, sellers, and administrators register, log in, manage their roles, and interact securely with the platform while supporting both traditional and modern (guest, OAuth) authentication methods.\n\n## 2. Objectives\n- Ensure robust and secure identity and access management for all user types\n- Provide seamless and flexible registration/login options, including external OAuth\n- Support role-based permissions and dynamic role escalation/approval flows\n- Centralize user profile and identity data for compliance and personalization\n\n## 3. User Roles\n| Role          | Description                                                                                                                   | Key Permissions                                              |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Customer      | Shopper who browses, purchases, earns rewards, and manages favorites/profile                                                  | Browse, purchase, review, favorite, profile mgmt             |\n| Seller        | Member who lists products, manages inventory, reviews sales analytics, and responds to queries (approval required)            | Product/inventory mgmt, view analytics, reply to customers   |\n| Administrator | Privileged user managing backend, users, products, compliance, analytics, and all system settings                             | All permissions (admin UI, config, compliance, auditing)     |\n\nThe system enforces clear separation between these roles using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). All APIs are protected by relevant role checks.\n\n## 4. User Registration and Login Flows\n**Supported authentication methods:**\n- Standard email/password registration and login\n- Guest access with temporary session profiles\n- External OAuth (Google, Apple, Kakao, Naver, etc.)\n\nAuthentication journey:\n1. **Registration**: Users can sign up (customer/seller) via email or OAuth; sellers require approval by admin before activation.\n2. **Login**: Users authenticate via their chosen method. Session tokens maintain secure state.\n3. **Role Assignment & Escalation**: Upon login, the backend loads role claims for each user and applies authorization gates accordingly. Seller role changes require audit/approval flow.\n\n### Mermaid Diagram: Login & Registration Flow (Summary)\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n  A[Start] --> B{Choose Login Method}\n  B -->|Email/Password| C[Enter credentials]\n  B -->|OAuth| D[Select OAuth Provider]\n  C --> E[Verify/2FA (opt)]\n  D --> E\n  E --> F{Role Type}\n  F -->|Customer| G[Load Customer Dashboard]\n  F -->|Seller| H{Approval Status}\n  H -->|Approved| I[Load Seller Portal]\n  H -->|Pending| J[Show Pending Notice]\n  F -->|Admin| K[Admin Console]\n```\n\n## 5. User Profile Management\n- Users access self-service portal to edit personal details, change passwords, manage connected accounts, and revoke sessions.\n- Profile contains display name, contact info, addresses, avatar, linked OAuth accounts, and preferences. Sensitive actions require re-authentication.\n\n## 6. Security and Compliance\n- All passwords securely hashed (bcrypt or better)\n- MFA/2FA available for all users (recommended, required for sellers/admins)\n- Access tokens are short-lived; refresh token rotation applied\n- Strict audit logging for role changes, admin operations, sensitive actions\n- GDPR/CCPA compliant consent, data deletion, and export tools integrated\n\n## 7. Role-Based Access Design\n- Each REST API endpoint enforces role-based authorization:\n    - Customers: Purchase, rewards, favorites, orders, personal info (scoped)\n    - Sellers: Product, inventory, analytics, and customer messaging (limited to their catalog)\n    - Administrators: Full management (system-wide)\n- APIs issue JWTs with role and scope claims per session.\n\n## 8. Acceptance Criteria\n- Users can register, upgrade, or revoke their role securely and smoothly\n- All user data updates/operations are logged and auditable\n- Role-restricted endpoints cannot be accessed by unauthorized users\n- Seamless OAuth integration & SSO for all supported providers\n- Compliance and data portability requirements are met\n\n---\n\n[Return to Table of Contents](./00_ai_shopmall_toc.md)\n","03_ai_shopmall_product_and_inventory_management.md":"# AI Shopmall – Product & Inventory Management\n\n---\n\n## 1.

It manages every phase from product selection through checkout, payment processing, shipment, returns, cancellations, and aftersales—while tightly integrated with user/identity, product/inventory, and promotions systems. This document serves as an actionable specification for developers, outlining flows, data models, real-world cases, and relationships with adjacent systems.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- **Cart Management**: Support add/update/delete for single/multiple SKUs, with real-time inventory validation, merging duplicate entries, handling limits (max per order, item, user). Edge cases include out-of-stock changes during shopping and price updates. Error scenarios: stockout at checkout, price changed after carted, exceeding available promo/redemption limits.\n   - Flow: On add-to-cart, system checks [product & inventory] (via `/inventory/check`) for quantity, price, and promotion eligibility, then updates session/user cart. If inventory depletes before checkout, cart shows warning and disables checkout button for that SKU. Example API call: `POST /cart/add {skuId, quantity, userId}`. Response includes updated cart state and warnings if any.\n\n- **Order Placement**: Enables one-click or multi-step checkout, supporting split orders by seller/warehouse, multi-shipping, and address validation. Edge: multi-seller split, different delivery schedules. Error: Address outside delivery area, payment failure, insufficient user role.\n   - Flow: User proceeds to checkout, system locks cart items (invoking `/inventory/lock`). Orders are split per seller for fulfillment, tracking per seller’s SLA. Example: `POST /order/checkout {cartId, addressId, paymentToken}`. State: pending → paid/failed. Errors are returned with failure codes (`OUT_OF_STOCK`, `INVALID_ADDRESS`).\n\n- **Payment Integration**: Connect with payment gateways (cards, wallets, points, rewards). Rollback cart/order on payment failure. Edge: guest checkout with limited payment methods. Includes secure handling of sensitive info.\n   - Pattern: `POST /payment/authorize {orderId, paymentMethod, userId}` → On success, triggers order confirmation, else emits payment error with guidance for next steps.\n\n- **Order Fulfillment & Logistics**: Coordinate with logistics partners (internal/third-party) for each order split, providing tracking, shipping updates, and estimated delivery. Errors: delayed handoff, lost item, nondelivery.\n   - API: `GET /order/status {orderId}` returns current state, per-item tracking number. State updates are pushed to customer and admin dashboards.\n\n- **Returns & Aftersales**: Allow returns, exchanges, or order cancellations before dispatch, handling both auto-approval (by rule) and manual review (operator). Includes fraud checks and auto-reversal of inventory and payment where valid.\n   - Scenario: User requests refund for partial item delivery. System verifies eligibility by status and rules, initiates payment reversal, and updates inventory.\n\n- **Notifications**: Real-time status updates (cart, order, shipment) via email/SMS/push, handled by messaging queue and user preferences.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Performance**: <300ms for key flows (add-to-cart, checkout, order query), aiming for 99.99% uptime. Scalability via stateless APIs, asynchronous job queues for fulfillment events, and hypermedia for order navigation.\n  - *Implementation*: Use CDN for static assets, cache inventory checks, autoscale service pools.\n\n- **Reliability**: ACID compliance on order/payment, distributed transaction management for split/rollback operations. SLAs: 99.99% order integrity, auto alert for failed jobs.\n\n- **Security**: PCI DSS for payment, GDPR compliant on PII, access scoped by user role. Implement rate limiting, anti-fraud, input sanitization.\n\n- **Traceability**: Full audit logs for every cart/order change, searchable by user, item, and timestamp. *Mitigation*: All events signed and timestamped.\n\n- **Testability**: Contract and end-to-end tests automated for each stage—cart, order, payment, fulfillment runs. Include mocks for third-party failures (payment, shipping).\n\n## Relationships to Other Systems\n### Product & Inventory Management ([see details](./03_ai_shopmall_product_and_inventory_management.md))\nThis system interfaces during add-to-cart (inventory, SKU/option mapping), price/finality-lock at checkout, and fulfillment (reserved stock release/conflict resolution). Models include `SKU`, `StockItem` (fields: `id`, `skuId`, `quantity`, `location`, `reservedForOrderId`). Errors include over-reservation (race), stale stock, and system sync failures. All adjustments are idempotent and audit-logged.\n\n### Promotion & Rewards System ([see details](./05_ai_shopmall_promotion_and_rewards_system.md))\nCart and order modules query/apply available promotions per line item or order (coupons, rewards, bundle discounts). Decision logic runs: eligibility (time, user role, inventory), stacking order, and best-benefit computation. On order update/cancel, reverses/adjusts applied promos. Conflict: mutually exclusive offers. Flow: `POST /promotion/apply {cartId, userId}` returns promo deductions, warnings, and affected items.\n\n### User & Identity Management ([see details](./02_ai_shopmall_user_and_identity_management.md))\nAll mutation APIs (cart/order/returns) require authentication scoped by `customer`, `seller`, or `admin` roles. Supports guest checkout (limited features: single-shipment, excludes rewards). Handles fraud/fake-user detection with CAPTCHA, device/fingerprint checks, and transaction velocity rules. Permission failures: API returns `401/403` with audit trail. Users can upgrade account or switch to full registration mid-flow.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Successful add-to-cart for in-stock and permitted SKUs, with error messages for out-of-stock, exceeding limits, and price/promo changes. Automated QA simulates concurrent adds and inventory race conditions.\n- Checkout flow supports split orders, promo application, address validation, and payment success/failure. Tests run for every combination of guest/registered, multiple addresses, and payment fallback cases.\n- Payment completion triggers fulfillment. Negative test: simulate gateway timeout or fraud rejection and check for order compensation.\n- Audit logs capture all changes, accessible and filterable for admins.\n- Order, cart, and fulfillment models and APIs covered by contract and end-to-end tests, with mocks for upstream (inventory, payment, shipping) failures.\n\n## Practical Examples & Flows\n- **Cart Add Example**:\n   - Request: `POST /cart/add {skuId: \"S901\", quantity: 2, userId: \"U123\"}`\n   - System: Validates inventory using `/inventory/check`, applies eligible promotions, and updates cart state.\n   - Response: `{cartId: \"C125\", items: [...], message: \"2 items added. Promotion X applied. Remaining stock: 18.\"}`\n   - Edge: If SKU is OOS, returns `{error: \"OUT_OF_STOCK\"}`\n\n- **Order Checkout Example**:\n   - Request: `POST /order/checkout {cartId, shipping: {...}, paymentToken}`\n   - Flow: System locks inventory, splits order per seller, validates promo, and initiates payment auth. On success, triggers fulfillment; on failure, rolls inventory/promo and returns error.\n\n- **Promo Application Example**:\n   - User applies coupon at checkout. System calls `/promotion/apply`, recalculates total, reverses promo if cart changes, resolves conflicts by business rules (e.g., best discount wins), and logs user/rule/decision.\n   \n---","05_ai_shopmall_promotion_and_rewards_system.md":"# Promotion and Rewards System Plan\n\n## 1.

Core features include managing favorites across products, addresses, and inquiries, tailoring notifications, and leveraging folders and tags for organization. Advanced personalization is achieved by learning user patterns and suggesting relevant content or promotions.\n\n---\n\n## Objectives\n- Increase user engagement and retention by offering customizable favorites and recommendations.\n- Streamline shopping experiences and repeat purchases.\n- Provide scalable personalization that adapts to various entity types (products, sellers, inquiries, addresses).\n\n---\n\n## User Journeys\n### Scenario 1: Adding and Removing a Favorite (Positive/Negative)\n- **Customer views a product:** The \"Add to Favorites\" button is displayed.\n    - **Step 1:** User taps the button. Confirmation appears, and the product is added to their default favorites folder.\n    - **Step 2:** User receives an optional prompt to categorize the favorite into a custom folder or add tags.\n    - **Negative Path 1:** If not logged in, the system prompts the user to log in or sign up before saving the favorite, with clear error messaging.\n    - **Negative Path 2:** If the favorite already exists in the chosen folder, a non-intrusive message advises the user.\n- **Removing a favorite:**\n    - **Step 1:** User clicks the “Remove from Favorites” icon beside a saved item.\n    - **Step 2:** The item is instantly removed, providing undo feedback.\n    - **Negative Path:** If the item was not found (sync issue), an error message is shown with troubleshooting advice.\n\n### Scenario 2: Notification Preferences (Positive/Negative)\n- **User opens notification settings:** A list of favorite-linked alerts (e.g., price drop, restock, product review response) is displayed.\n    - **Step 1:** User toggles notification types (push, email, SMS).\n    - **Step 2:** User chooses to mute notifications for specific folders.\n    - **Negative Path:** If the system fails to update preferences (connectivity, error), the UI notifies and reverts changes.\n    - **Opt-out case:** User declines all notifications; system respects and confirms their selection.\n\n### Scenario 3: Organizing Favorites in Folders\n- **Step 1:** User creates, renames, or deletes folders.\n- **Step 2:** Favorites are moved between folders by drag-and-drop or bulk selection.\n- **Negative Path:** Trying to delete a folder containing favorites prompts for confirmation; deletion only proceeds if the user selects to either move or delete the contained entries.\n\n---\n\n## Functional Requirements (with examples)\n1. **Add/Remove Favorites**\n    - Users may add any supported entity (product, seller, address, inquiry) to favorites.\n    - Example: Add product #1001 to \"Spring Sale\" folder, tag as \"Gift Idea.\"\n    - Edge: Prevent duplicate entries within the same folder and type.\n2. **Folder & Tag Management**\n    - Users create, rename, or delete folders.\n    - Favorites can be tagged for fast filtering: “Organic”, “Wishlist”, etc.\n    - Example: Move two addresses to \"Holiday List.\"\n3. **Notification Preferences**\n    - Users toggle notification types (push/email/SMS) per favorite or folder.\n    - Muting notifications per item/folder is supported.\n    - Example: Enable push for price drops in “Wishlist”; mute notifications entirely for \"Work Supplies.\"\n4. **Multi-entity Support**\n    - Supported entities: products, sellers, addresses, inquiries (all with unique IDs).\n    - Flows are similar regardless of entity, but metadata varies (e.g., address notes vs. product specs).\n5. **Bulk Actions**\n    - Select multiple entries to move, tag, or delete in a single operation.\n    - Example: Bulk-remove 10 old favorites.\n\n---\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Security**\n    - Favorites data is encrypted at rest and in transit (AES-256/TLS 1.3+).\n    - Role-based access ensures users manage only their own favorites.\n    - GDPR compliance: Favorite lists and logs exportable as downloadable files; users can request deletion per GDPR \"right to be forgotten.\"\n- **Performance**\n    - All actions complete in <500ms for up to 5,000 favorites per user.\n- **Reliability**\n    - Bulk operations are transactional: partial failures auto-rollback.\n- **Logging & Audit**\n    - All access/changes logged with user ID, timestamp, IP.\n    - Unauthorized or failed attempts are monitored and audited.\n\n---\n\n## Data Model & ERD\n### Entities\n- **User** (`user_id`): Owner of favorites and folders.\n- **Favorite** (`favorite_id`, `entity_type`, `entity_id`, `folder_id`, `user_id`, `tags`, `created_at`): Maps user to item or entity.\n- **Folder** (`folder_id`, `user_id`, `name`): Used to group favorites; can be default or user-created.\n- **NotificationPreference** (`preference_id`, `user_id`, `target_id`, `target_type`, `notif_types_enabled`): Stores delivery types and scope (item/folder/all).\n\n### Relationships\n- One user has multiple folders; each folder is unique per user.\n- One favorite belongs to one folder but can carry multiple tags.\n- Notification preferences can be scoped to either favorite or folder (distinguished by `target_type`).\n\n### Sample Data Table\n| user_id | favorite_id | entity_type | entity_id | folder_id | tags        | created_at           |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------------------|\n| 55      | 101         | product     | 1001      | 900       | \"gift, eco\" | 2025-07-21T10:05:00Z |\n| 55      | 102         | address     | 458       | 901       | \"home\"      | 2025-07-21T13:22:00Z |\n\n### ERD (Mermaid)\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n    USER ||--o{ FOLDER : owns\n    USER ||--o{ NOTIFICATIONPREFERENCE : \"sets\"\n    FOLDER ||--o{ FAVORITE : holds\n    FAVORITE }o--|| NOTIFICATIONPREFERENCE : \"triggers\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria (including edge cases)\n- ✅ User can add/remove any supported entity to favorites when logged in.\n- ✅ User cannot favorite or organize items if not logged in (system prompts for login).\n- ✅ No duplicate favorites within same folder/entity.\n- ✅ User can decline or customize notifications for any favorite or folder.\n- ✅ Attempting to remove a non-existent or already-removed favorite returns a user-visible error.\n- ✅ Folders cannot be deleted if containing favorites without explicit user confirmation.\n- ✅ Favorites data remains private per user; unauthorized access attempts are denied and logged.\n- ✅ Bulk actions properly handle partial errors with rollback and messaging.\n- ✅ GDPR requests for data access/export or erasure are fulfilled within 30 days.\n- ✅ Notifications are not sent more than once per state change (e.g., avoid duplicate alerts).\n- ✅ Role permissions: only the owning user and admins (when permitted) may view or manage a user’s favorites.\n","09_ai_shopmall_extensibility_and_system_structure.md":"# AI Shopmall Extensibility & System Structure\n\n## Overview\nThe AI Shopmall platform is designed as a modular, scalable, and highly extensible commerce solution. This document outlines the core extensibility strategies, section and channel structures, attachment/file management, and system architecture patterns. It is intended to guide ongoing system enhancements and seamless third-party integrations while maintaining robust performance and security.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Extensibility Principles\n- **API-First Orientation:** The Shopmall exposes functionality via secure RESTful APIs and offers GraphQL endpoints for advanced integrations. All core modules (users, inventory, order, content) are accessible and extensible.\n- **Plugin/Module Architecture:** The core system supports dynamic loading of feature modules (e.g., payment gateways, analytics, AI-recommendation widgets) with defined extension points.\n- **Channel & Sectionization:** Business logic and UI/UX can be partitioned into channels (e.g., web, mobile, in-store kiosk) and functional sections (e.g., product list, cart, admin). Each channel/section can override or extend base behaviors with minimal coupling.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Integration Model\n- **Third-Party Apps and APIs:**\n  - OAuth 2.0 with granular scopes for secure external access\n  - Webhooks for event-driven integration (e.g., order/payment/shipment notifications)\n  - API rate limiting & throttling to ensure platform stability\n- **Attachment & File Handling:**\n  - Secure upload/download APIs for product images, manuals, reviews\n  - Role-based access: customers, sellers, and admins each have scoped file privileges\n  - Version control for attachments to prevent stale assets\n\n---\n\n## 3. Performance & Scalability\n- **Horizontal Scaling:** Stateless service design combined with distributed queue systems enables scaling across multiple nodes and regions.\n- **Caching Strategies:** Multi-layered cache (in-memory, distributed) for public sections, with cache invalidation hooks on product/update triggers.\n- **Asynchronous Processing:** Heavy tasks (bulk imports, image processing, analytics) are offloaded to task queues and processed asynchronously.\n- **Monitoring & Auto-Healing:** Integration with real-time monitoring (APM, logs, alerts) and auto-recovery mechanisms minimize downtime.\n\n---\n\n## 4. System Structure Diagram\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Web/Mobile/Kiosk Channels] -->|API Calls| B{API Gateway}\n    B --> C[Core Shopmall Services]\n    C --> D1[User Module]\n    C --> D2[Inventory Module]\n    C --> D3[Order & Cart Module]\n    C --> D4[Content & Review Module]\n    C --> E[Plugin/Extension Loader]\n    E --> F1[3rd-Party Apps]\n    E --> F2[Custom Widgets]\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Extensibility Roadmap & Guidelines\n- **Future-Proofing:** All new APIs and extension points must be backward compatible and strictly versioned\n- **Documentation:** Public and internal interfaces are documented with OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas and kept up-to-date\n- **Security:** All extensibility mechanisms (plugins, APIs, files) undergo regular security audits and enforce principle of least privilege.\n\n---\n\n## References\n- [01_ai_shopmall_system_overview.md](./01_ai_shopmall_system_overview.md)\n- [03_ai_shopmall_product_and_inventory_management.md](./03_ai_shopmall_product_and_inventory_management.md)\n- [10_ai_shopmall_rules_security_and_compliance.md](./10_ai_shopmall_rules_security_and_compliance.md)\n","10_ai_shopmall_rules_security_and_compliance.md":"# AI Shopmall Rules, Security, and Compliance\n\n## Overview\nThis document defines the business rules, regulatory requirements, security standards, data privacy obligations, accessibility guidelines, and audit procedures for the AI Shopmall platform.

Notification Preferences (Positive/Negative)\n- **User opens notification settings:** A list of favorite-linked alerts (e.g., price drop, restock, product review response) is displayed.\n    - **Step 1:** User toggles notification types (push, email, SMS).\n    - **Step 2:** User chooses to mute notifications for specific folders.\n    - **Negative Path:** If the system fails to update preferences (connectivity, error), the UI notifies and reverts changes.\n    - **Opt-out case:** User declines all notifications; system respects and confirms their selection.\n\n### Scenario 3: Organizing Favorites in Folders\n- **Step 1:** User creates, renames, or deletes folders.\n- **Step 2:** Favorites are moved between folders by drag-and-drop or bulk selection.\n- **Negative Path:** Trying to delete a folder containing favorites prompts for confirmation; deletion only proceeds if the user selects to either move or delete the contained entries.\n\n---\n\n## Functional Requirements (with examples)\n1. **Add/Remove Favorites**\n    - Users may add any supported entity (product, seller, address, inquiry) to favorites.\n    - Example: Add product #1001 to \"Spring Sale\" folder, tag as \"Gift Idea.\"\n    - Edge: Prevent duplicate entries within the same folder and type.\n2. **Folder & Tag Management**\n    - Users create, rename, or delete folders.\n    - Favorites can be tagged for fast filtering: “Organic”, “Wishlist”, etc.\n    - Example: Move two addresses to \"Holiday List.\"\n3. **Notification Preferences**\n    - Users toggle notification types (push/email/SMS) per favorite or folder.\n    - Muting notifications per item/folder is supported.\n    - Example: Enable push for price drops in “Wishlist”; mute notifications entirely for \"Work Supplies.\"\n4. **Multi-entity Support**\n    - Supported entities: products, sellers, addresses, inquiries (all with unique IDs).\n    - Flows are similar regardless of entity, but metadata varies (e.g., address notes vs. product specs).\n5. **Bulk Actions**\n    - Select multiple entries to move, tag, or delete in a single operation.\n    - Example: Bulk-remove 10 old favorites.\n\n---\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Security**\n    - Favorites data is encrypted at rest and in transit (AES-256/TLS 1.3+).\n    - Role-based access ensures users manage only their own favorites.\n    - GDPR compliance: Favorite lists and logs exportable as downloadable files; users can request deletion per GDPR \"right to be forgotten.\"\n- **Performance**\n    - All actions complete in <500ms for up to 5,000 favorites per user.\n- **Reliability**\n    - Bulk operations are transactional: partial failures auto-rollback.\n- **Logging & Audit**\n    - All access/changes logged with user ID, timestamp, IP.\n    - Unauthorized or failed attempts are monitored and audited.\n\n---\n\n## Data Model & ERD\n### Entities\n- **User** (`user_id`): Owner of favorites and folders.\n- **Favorite** (`favorite_id`, `entity_type`, `entity_id`, `folder_id`, `user_id`, `tags`, `created_at`): Maps user to item or entity.\n- **Folder** (`folder_id`, `user_id`, `name`): Used to group favorites; can be default or user-created.\n- **NotificationPreference** (`preference_id`, `user_id`, `target_id`, `target_type`, `notif_types_enabled`): Stores delivery types and scope (item/folder/all).\n\n### Relationships\n- One user has multiple folders; each folder is unique per user.\n- One favorite belongs to one folder but can carry multiple tags.\n- Notification preferences can be scoped to either favorite or folder (distinguished by `target_type`).\n\n### Sample Data Table\n| user_id | favorite_id | entity_type | entity_id | folder_id | tags        | created_at           |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------------------|\n| 55      | 101         | product     | 1001      | 900       | \"gift, eco\" | 2025-07-21T10:05:00Z |\n| 55      | 102         | address     | 458       | 901       | \"home\"      | 2025-07-21T13:22:00Z |\n\n### ERD (Mermaid)\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n    USER ||--o{ FOLDER :

edge cases)\n- ✅ User can add/remove any supported entity to favorites when logged in.\n- ✅ User cannot favorite or organize items if not logged in (system prompts for login).\n- ✅ No duplicate favorites within same folder/entity.\n- ✅ User can decline or customize notifications for any favorite or folder.\n- ✅ Attempting to remove a non-existent or already-removed favorite returns a user-visible error.\n- ✅ Folders cannot be deleted if containing favorites without explicit user confirmation.\n- ✅ Favorites data remains private per user; unauthorized access attempts are denied and logged.\n- ✅ Bulk actions properly handle partial errors with rollback and messaging.\n- ✅ GDPR requests for data access/export or erasure are fulfilled within 30 days.\n- ✅ Notifications are not sent more than once per state change (e.g., avoid duplicate alerts).\n- ✅ Role permissions: only the owning user and admins (when permitted) may view or manage a user’s favorites.\n"},"total":33,"completed":4,"step":0,"created_at":"2025-07-22T13:04:43.515Z"},"tokenUsage":{"facade":{"aggregate":{"total":77856,"input":{"total":73011,"cached":1920},"output":{"total":4845,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":77856,"input":{"total":73011,"cached":1920},"output":{"total":4845,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"analyze":{"aggregate":{"total":54896,"input":{"total":51350,"cached":1920},"output":{"total":3546,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":54896,"input":{"total":51350,"cached":1920},"output":{"total":3546,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"prisma":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"interface":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"test":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"realize":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"descri

AI Shopmall – Content Review & Engagement System\n\n## Overview\nThis document outlines the vision, strategy, and requirements for the Content Review & Engagement System within the AI Shopmall platform. The goal is to empower customers, sellers, and administrators to interact transparently, ensuring quality information sharing, feedback mechanisms, and active community engagement while maintaining compliance, trust, and safety.\n\n## Objectives\n- Deliver robust product review and rating features to foster trust and social proof.\n- Facilitate open Q&A between customers and sellers for pre- and post-purchase support.\n- Enable bulletin board discussions (announcements, community, FAQ boards) moderated by administrators.\n- Provide scalable content moderation (AI & human-in-loop) to filter spam, abuse, and breaches of guidelines.\n- Track history and engagement analytics for continuous improvement.\n\n## User Personas\n- **Customer:** Writes reviews, ratings, questions, and discussions. Flags content.\n- **Seller:** Responds to reviews/questions, manages their product interactions.\n- **Administrator:** Moderates all content, reviews reports, and oversees engagement metrics.\n\n## User Journeys\n1. **Product Review Submission:** Customer purchases a product, leaves a text review, star rating, and optional media; seller can respond. Reviews are filtered for policy compliance.\n2. **Q&A Interaction:** Customer submits a product-related question. Seller or admin responds publicly; notifications sent on reply/update.\n3. **Bulletin Board Engagement:** Users read or comment on platform/community announcements, FAQ, and policy updates. Admin moderates discussions.\n4. **Reporting & Moderation:** Any user flags inappropriate content; AI pre-filters are applied; admin reviews flagged items with action history logged.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- **Review System**: Create, edit, delete, like, and report reviews; attach media; see seller responses; filter/sort by date, rating, and helpfulness.\n- **Rating Aggregation**: Calculate and display average ratings per product, seller, and globally.\n- **Q&A Board**: Submit public/private questions; thread and group comments by topic.\n- **Bulletin Board**: Post/read/comment on admin and community posts; pin important updates; support category/tagging.\n- **Content Moderation Tools**: Automatic AI scans for inappropriate language, spam, fake reviews, and offensive content; admin moderation dashboard with batch actions.\n- **History Tracking**: Audit logs for edits, moderation actions, and engagement metrics.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Performance**: Moderate response times for content load and posting.\n- **Reliability**: Ensure zero data loss for reviews/Q&A; maintain moderation logs.\n- **Scalability**: Handle peak participation during campaigns and viral events.\n- **Privacy & Compliance**: Enforce GDPR/CCPA for user-generated content.\n- **Accessibility**: Compliant UI for screen readers, mobile, and users with disabilities.\n\n## Metrics & Success Criteria\n- Review/Q&A response rates & times\n- Moderation speed (auto vs. manual)\n- Engagement rates (likes, comments, flags)\n- Reduction in policy-violating content over time\n- User satisfaction via feedback and NPS\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- A user can post, edit, or delete their own review or Q&A entry.\n- Sellers are notified and can respond to product questions and reviews.\n- All content is auditable with a visible edit/moderation history.\n- Flagged content is processed within a defined SLA.\n- Moderation action logs are retained for compliance review.\n\n##

AI Shopmall Extensibility & System Structure\n\n## Overview\nThe AI Shopmall platform is designed as a modular, scalable, and highly extensible commerce solution. This document outlines the core extensibility strategies, section and channel structures, attachment/file management, and system architecture patterns. It is intended to guide ongoing system enhancements and seamless third-party integrations while maintaining robust performance and security.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Extensibility Principles\n- **API-First Orientation:** The Shopmall exposes functionality via secure RESTful APIs and offers GraphQL endpoints for advanced integrations. All core modules (users, inventory, order, content) are accessible and extensible.\n- **Plugin/Module Architecture:** The core system supports dynamic loading of feature modules (e.g., payment gateways, analytics, AI-recommendation widgets) with defined extension points.\n- **Channel & Sectionization:** Business logic and UI/UX can be partitioned into channels (e.g., web, mobile, in-store kiosk) and functional sections (e.g., product list, cart, admin). Each channel/section can override or extend base behaviors with minimal coupling.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Integration Model\n- **Third-Party Apps and APIs:**\n  - OAuth 2.0 with granular scopes for secure external access\n  - Webhooks for event-driven integration (e.g., order/payment/shipment notifications)\n  - API rate limiting & throttling to ensure platform stability\n- **Attachment & File Handling:**\n  - Secure upload/download APIs for product images, manuals, reviews\n  - Role-based access: customers, sellers, and admins each have scoped file privileges\n  - Version control for attachments to prevent stale assets\n\n---\n\n## 3. Performance & Scalability\n- **Horizontal Scaling:** Stateless service design combined with distributed queue systems enables scaling across multiple nodes and regions.\n- **Caching Strategies:** Multi-layered cache (in-memory, distributed) for public sections, with cache invalidation hooks on product/update triggers.\n- **Asynchronous Processing:** Heavy tasks (bulk imports, image processing, analytics) are offloaded to task queues and processed asynchronously.\n- **Monitoring & Auto-Healing:** Integration with real-time monitoring (APM, logs, alerts) and auto-recovery mechanisms minimize downtime.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Extensibility Roadmap & Guidelines\n- **Future-Proofing:** All new APIs and extension points must be backward compatible and strictly versioned\n- **Documentation:** Public and internal interfaces are documented with OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas and kept up-to-date\n- **Security:** All extensibility mechanisms (plugins, APIs, files) undergo regular security audits and enforce principle of least privilege.\n\n---\n\n## References\n- [01_ai_shopmall_system_overview.md](./01_ai_shopmall_system_overview.md)\n-

Security Policies\n- All data transmissions use strong encryption protocols (e.g., TLS).\n- Regular vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and patching cycles.\n- Secure authentication (multi-factor for sellers/admins; password complexity enforced).\n- Role-based access control to restrict sensitive operations.\n- Incident response plan and breach notification procedures.\n\n## 4. Privacy and Data Protection\n- Limit personal information collection to essential data fields.\n- User consent and preferences are mandatory for data sharing and marketing.\n- Data anonymization for analytics and research whenever possible.\n- Users can access, export, or delete their personal data. See [Data Lifecycles](#data-lifecycle-and-retention).\n\n## 5. Accessibility & Inclusivity\n- UI/UX follows WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines ensuring usability for everyone.\n- Support for assistive devices, clear language, and adjustable displays.\n- Accessibility testing integrated into product releases.\n\n## 6. Audit Logging & Monitoring\n- All financial, authentication, and administrative actions are logged.\n- Logs are immutable, timestamped, and include context for audit investigations.\n- Retention and review policies comply with business and legal requirements.\n- Automated anomaly alerts for critical security events.\n\n## 7. Continuous Compliance Operations\n- Ongoing compliance training for employees and admins.\n- Periodic policy reviews and risk assessments; update on legislative changes.\n- Vendor and third-party integrations undergo due diligence and risk management.\n\n## 8. Data Lifecycle and Retention\n### 8.1 Data Retention Schedules\n- Personal data is retained only as long as required for business or legal obligations, or as authorized by the user.\n- Transactional records (orders, payments) are stored for at least 5 years to meet regulatory, audit, and tax requirements.\n- Session data, temporary logs, and analytics are retained for a maximum of 90 days unless extended by explicit need.\n\n### 8.2 Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation\n- Collect the minimum dataset necessary per purpose or service feature.\n- Regular audits ensure excess or obsolete data is flagged for review and deletion.\n\n### 8.3 Deletion Procedures & Secure Disposal\n- Users can request account and data deletion; all personal data will be purged, except for records required by law (e.g., financial and tax compliance).\n- Automated and manual workflows monitor retention timelines, triggering deletion where applicable.\n- Deleted data is securely destroyed using industry-standard data sanitization techniques, including cryptographic wiping and physical media disposal for backups.\n\n### 8.4 Compliance and Privacy Integration\n- Data lifecycle policies fulfill user rights regarding access, rectification, deletion, and portability.\n- All retention and disposal steps are fully documented and auditable.\n- Business partners and processors are contractually obliged to adhere to the same lifecycle and retention standards.\n"},"total":33,"completed":7,"step":0,"created_at":"2025-07-22T13:04:45.446Z"},"tokenUsage":{"facade":{"aggregate":{"total":104672,"input":{"total":97608,"cached":3840},"output":{"total":7064,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":104672,"input":{"total":97608,"cached":3840},"output":{"total":7064,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"analyze":{"aggregate":{"total":81712,"input":{"total":75947,"cached":3840},"output":{"total":5765,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":81712,"input":{"total":75947,"cached":3840},"output":{"total":5765,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"prisma":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"interface":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"test":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"realize":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"desc

AI and Analytics Platform for AI-Powered Shopmall\n\n## Overview\nThe AI and Analytics Platform provides powerful intelligence, automation, and actionable insight across the entire shopping mall ecosystem. By integrating advanced AI modules, the platform optimizes personalized recommendations, strengthens fraud prevention, offers deep customer insights, and enables predictive and real-time analytics for all stakeholders: customers, sellers, and administrators.\n\n---\n## Objectives\n- Enhance user experience with dynamic, personalized content and product recommendations.\n- Improve platform trust and security via real-time fraud detection and anomaly monitoring.\n- Empower sellers and administrators with actionable business intelligence and visual dashboards.\n- Provide real-time and predictive analytics to inform strategic decisions and system tuning.\n\n---\n## Key Components\n**1. Recommendation Engine**\n- Personalizes product discovery for each customer using browsing, buying, and engagement behaviors.\n- Supports product, promotional, and content suggestions, dynamically updating as customer interests evolve.\n- Integrates with favorites, cart, and feedback modules for closed-loop improvement.\n\n**2. Fraud Detection Module**\n- Continuously scans for suspicious transactions, login attempts, and seller activities in real-time.\n- Uses machine learning models to flag, escalate, or block abnormal activities (e.g., account takeover, fake reviews, fraudulent orders), feeding events to the admin compliance dashboard.\n\n**3. Customer Insights Dashboard**\n- Multi-role analytics: tailored views for customer (purchase trends, rewards earned), seller (inventory turnover, sales analytics), and admin (system health, compliance, active campaigns).\n- Interactive filtering, time-series visualization, and segment-based drilldowns augment usability.\n\n**4. Real-Time and Predictive Analytics**\n- Monitors site KPIs: engagement, conversion, churn forecasts, average order value, and more.\n- Provides trend forecasting and what-if scenario tools for sellers/admins.\n- Event-based triggers can prompt adaptive deals or recommendations.\n\n---\n## User Roles & Interactions\n| Role           | Analytics Platform Interaction                                                             |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Customer       | Receives personalized recommendations, sees order/purchase insights, tracks rewards       |\n| Seller         | Accesses sales trends, product performance, predictive demand insights, fraud alerts      |\n| Administrator  | Monitors platform health, views aggregate KPIs, reviews fraud detection alerts, manages AI|\n\n---\n## Functional Requirements\n1. **Personalized Recommendations**\n    - Serve top-N suggestions for products, deals, and content widgets per customer session.\n    - Adapt continuously based on user feedback and actions.\n2. **Fraud Detection & Alerting**\n    - Real-time monitoring of transactions, ratings, and user behaviors.\n    - Automated response (block, flag, escalate) and logging for compliance.\n3. **Dashboards & Reporting**\n    - Visualize actionable metrics for each user role.\n    - Export and share analytic reports in various formats.\n4. **Predictive Analytics**\n    - Predict churn, demand spikes, campaign efficacy using historical and contextual data.\n5. **Role-Based Access**\n    - Manage data visibility and analytic feature access by role (customer, seller, admin).\n\n---\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Scalability**: Support real-time analytics for 10K+ concurrent users.\n- **Privacy & Security**: Ensure AI models comply with data privacy, transparency, and auditability standards.\n- **Performance**: Recommendations and fraud checks must not add noticeable latency (<200ms per request).\n\n---\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Recommendation engine delivers accurate product suggestions, validated via CTR and conversion KPIs.\n- Anomalous activity detects >90% of simulated fraud scenarios in the test environment.\n- All dashboards load within 3 seconds and provide role-specific insights.\n- Predictive analytics yield actionable recommendations and visualizations for business stakeholders.\n\n---\n## Data Model & High-Level Flows\n\n**Overview of Data Flow:**\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\nA[User Events (clicks, purchases)] --> B[Event Collector]\nB --> C[AI/ML Layer: Recommendation & Fraud Detection]\nC --> D[Analytics Data Store]\nD --> E[Dashboards & Real-Time API]\nC --> F[Trigger Recommendations/Alerts]\n```\n\n**Entities Overview

AI Shopmall – Content Review & Engagement System\n\n## Overview\nThis document outlines the vision, strategy, and requirements for the Content Review & Engagement System within the AI Shopmall platform. The goal is to empower customers, sellers, and administrators to interact transparently, ensuring quality information sharing, feedback mechanisms, and active community engagement while maintaining compliance, trust, and safety.\n\n## Objectives\n- Deliver robust product review and rating features to foster trust and social proof.\n- Facilitate open Q&A between customers and sellers for pre- and post-purchase support.\n- Enable bulletin board discussions (announcements, community, FAQ boards) moderated by administrators.\n- Provide scalable content moderation (AI & human-in-loop) to filter spam, abuse, and breaches of guidelines.\n- Track history and engagement analytics for continuous improvement.\n\n## User Personas\n- **Customer:** Writes reviews, ratings, questions, and discussions. Flags content.\n- **Seller:** Responds to reviews/questions, manages their product interactions.\n- **Administrator:** Moderates all content, reviews reports, and oversees engagement metrics.\n\n## User Journeys\n1. **Product Review Submission:** Customer purchases a product, leaves a text review, star rating, and optional media; seller can respond. Reviews are filtered for policy compliance.\n2. **Q&A Interaction:** Customer submits a product-related question. Seller or admin responds publicly; notifications sent on reply/update.\n3. **Bulletin Board Engagement:** Users read or comment on platform/community announcements, FAQ, and policy updates. Admin moderates discussions.\n4. **Reporting & Moderation:** Any user flags inappropriate content; AI pre-filters are applied; admin reviews flagged items with action history logged.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- **Review System**: Create, edit, delete, like, and report reviews; attach media; see seller responses; filter/sort by date, rating, and helpfulness.\n- **Rating Aggregation**: Calculate and display average ratings per product, seller, and globally.\n- **Q&A Board**: Submit public/private questions; thread and group comments by topic.\n- **Bulletin Board**: Post/read/comment on admin and community posts; pin important updates; support category/tagging.\n- **Content Moderation Tools**: Automatic AI scans for inappropriate language, spam, fake reviews, and offensive content; admin moderation dashboard with batch actions.\n- **History Tracking**: Audit logs for edits, moderation actions, and engagement metrics.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Performance**: Moderate response times for content load and posting.\n- **Reliability**: Ensure zero data loss for reviews/Q&A; maintain moderation logs.\n- **Scalability**: Handle peak participation during campaigns and viral events.\n- **Privacy & Compliance**: Enforce GDPR/CCPA for user-generated content.\n- **Accessibility**: Compliant UI for screen readers, mobile, and users with disabilities.\n\n## Metrics & Success Criteria\n- Review/Q&A response rates & times\n- Moderation speed (auto vs. manual)\n- Engagement rates (likes, comments, flags)\n- Reduction in policy-violating content over time\n- User satisfaction via feedback and NPS\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- A user can post, edit, or delete their own review or Q&A entry.\n- Sellers are notified and can respond to product questions and reviews.\n- All content is auditable with a visible edit/moderation history.\n- Flagged content is processed within a defined SLA.\n- Moderation action logs are retained for compliance review.\n\n##

Order, Cart, and Fulfillment System\n\n## Overview\nThe Order, Cart, and Fulfillment System is a foundational set of modules in the AI-powered shopmall. It manages every phase from product selection through checkout, payment processing, shipment, returns, cancellations, and aftersales—while tightly integrated with user/identity, product/inventory, and promotions systems. This document serves as an actionable specification for developers, outlining flows, data models, real-world cases, and relationships with adjacent systems.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- **Cart Management**: Support add/update/delete for single/multiple SKUs, with real-time inventory validation, merging duplicate entries, handling limits (max per order, item, user). Edge cases include out-of-stock changes during shopping and price updates. Error scenarios: stockout at checkout, price changed after carted, exceeding available promo/redemption limits.\n   - Flow: On add-to-cart, system checks [product & inventory] (via `/inventory/check`) for quantity, price, and promotion eligibility, then updates session/user cart. If inventory depletes before checkout, cart shows warning and disables checkout button for that SKU. Example API call: `POST /cart/add {skuId, quantity, userId}`. Response includes updated cart state and warnings if any.\n\n- **Order Placement**: Enables one-click or multi-step checkout, supporting split orders by seller/warehouse, multi-shipping, and address validation. Edge: multi-seller split, different delivery schedules. Error: Address outside delivery area, payment failure, insufficient user role.\n   - Flow: User proceeds to checkout, system locks cart items (invoking `/inventory/lock`). Orders are split per seller for fulfillment, tracking per seller’s SLA. Example: `POST /order/checkout {cartId, addressId, paymentToken}`. State: pending → paid/failed. Errors are returned with failure codes (`OUT_OF_STOCK`, `INVALID_ADDRESS`).\n\n- **Payment Integration**: Connect with payment gateways (cards, wallets, points, rewards). Rollback cart/order on payment failure. Edge: guest checkout with limited payment methods. Includes secure handling of sensitive info.\n   - Pattern: `POST /payment/authorize {orderId, paymentMethod, userId}` → On success, triggers order confirmation, else emits payment error with guidance for next steps.\n\n- **Order Fulfillment & Logistics**: Coordinate with logistics partners (internal/third-party) for each order split, providing tracking, shipping updates, and estimated delivery. Errors: delayed handoff, lost item, nondelivery.\n   - API: `GET /order/status {orderId}` returns current state, per-item tracking number. State updates are pushed to customer and admin dashboards.\n\n- **Returns & Aftersales**: Allow returns, exchanges, or order cancellations before dispatch, handling both auto-approval (by rule) and manual review (operator). Includes fraud checks and auto-reversal of inventory and payment where valid.\n   - Scenario: User requests refund for partial item delivery. System verifies eligibility by status and rules, initiates payment reversal, and updates inventory.\n\n- **Notifications**: Real-time status updates (cart, order, shipment) via email/SMS/push, handled by messaging queue and user preferences.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Performance**: <300ms for key flows (add-to-cart, checkout, order query), aiming for 99.99% uptime. Scalability via stateless APIs, asynchronous job queues for fulfillment events, and hypermedia for order navigation.\n  - *Implementation*: Use CDN for static assets, cache inventory checks, autoscale service pools.\n\n- **Reliability**: ACID compliance on order/payment, distributed transaction management for split/rollback operations. SLAs: 99.99% order integrity, auto alert for failed jobs.\n\n- **Security**: PCI DSS for payment, GDPR compliant on PII, access scoped by user role. Implement rate limiting, anti-fraud, input sanitization.\n\n- **Traceability**: Full audit logs for every cart/order change, searchable by user, item, and timestamp. *Mitigation*: All events signed and timestamped.\n\n- **Testability**: Contract and end-to-end tests automated for each stage—cart, order, payment, fulfillment runs. Include mocks for third-party failures (payment, shipping).\n\n## Relationships to Other Systems\n### Product & Inventory Management ([see details](./03_ai_shopmall_product_and_inventory_management.md))\nThis system interfaces during add-to-cart (inventory, SKU/option mapping), price/finality-lock at checkout, and fulfillment (reserved stock release/conflict resolution). Models include `SKU`, `StockItem` (fields: `id`, `skuId`, `quantity`, `location`, `reservedForOrderId`). Errors include over-reservation (race), stale stock, and system sync failures. All adjustments are idempotent and audit-logged.\n\n### Promotion & Rewards System ([see details](./05_ai_shopmall_promotion_and_rewards_system.md))\nCart and order modules query/apply available promotions per line item or order (coupons, rewards, bundle discounts). Decision logic runs: eligibility (time, user role, inventory), stacking order, and best-benefit computation. On order update/cancel, reverses/adjusts applied promos. Conflict: mutually exclusive offers. Flow: `POST /promotion/apply {cartId, userId}` returns promo deductions, warnings, and affected items.\n\n### User & Identity Management ([see details](./02_ai_shopmall_user_and_identity_management.md))\nAll mutation APIs (cart/order/returns) require authentication scoped by `customer`, `seller`, or `admin` roles. Supports guest checkout (limited features: single-shipment, excludes rewards). Handles fraud/fake-user detection with CAPTCHA, device/fingerprint checks, and transaction velocity rules. Permission failures: API returns `401/403` with audit trail. Users can upgrade account or switch to full registration mid-flow.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Successful add-to-cart for in-stock and permitted SKUs, with error messages for out-of-stock, exceeding limits, and price/promo changes. Automated QA simulates concurrent adds and inventory race conditions.\n- Checkout flow supports split orders, promo application, address validation, and payment success/failure. Tests run for every combination of guest/registered, multiple addresses, and payment fallback cases.\n- Payment completion triggers fulfillment. Negative test: simulate gateway timeout or fraud rejection and check for order compensation.\n- Audit logs capture all changes, accessible and filterable for admins.\n- Order, cart, and fulfillment models and APIs covered by contract and end-to-end tests, with mocks for upstream (inventory, payment, shipping) failures.\n\n## Practical Examples & Flows\n- **Cart Add Example**:\n   - Request: `POST /cart/add {skuId: \"S901\", quantity: 2, userId: \"U123\"}`\n   - System: Validates inventory using `/inventory/check`, applies eligible promotions, and updates cart state.\n   - Response: `{cartId: \"C125\", items: [...], message: \"2 items added. Promotion X applied. Remaining stock: 18.\"}`\n   - Edge: If SKU is OOS, returns `{error: \"OUT_OF_STOCK\"}`\n\n- **Order Checkout Example**:\n   - Request: `POST /order/checkout {cartId, shipping: {...}, paymentToken}`\n   - Flow: System locks inventory, splits order per seller, validates promo, and initiates payment auth.

AI Shopmall – User and Identity Management\n\n## 1. Overview\nThe User and Identity Management system for the AI Shopmall establishes secure, scalable, and user-friendly foundations for all authentication and authorization flows. It defines how customers, sellers, and administrators register, log in, manage their roles, and interact securely with the platform while supporting both traditional and modern (guest, OAuth) authentication methods.\n\n## 2. Objectives\n- Ensure robust and secure identity and access management for all user types\n- Provide seamless and flexible registration/login options, including external OAuth\n- Support role-based permissions and dynamic role escalation/approval flows\n- Centralize user profile and identity data for compliance and personalization\n\n## 3. User Roles\n| Role          | Description                                                                                                                   | Key Permissions                                              |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Customer      | Shopper who browses, purchases, earns rewards, and manages favorites/profile                                                  | Browse, purchase, review, favorite, profile mgmt             |\n| Seller        | Member who lists products, manages inventory, reviews sales analytics, and responds to queries (approval required)            | Product/inventory mgmt, view analytics, reply to customers   |\n| Administrator | Privileged user managing backend, users, products, compliance, analytics, and all system settings                             | All permissions (admin UI, config, compliance, auditing)     |\n\nThe system enforces clear separation between these roles using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). All APIs are protected by relevant role checks.\n\n## 4. User Registration and Login Flows\n**Supported authentication methods:**\n- Standard email/password registration and login\n- Guest access with temporary session profiles\n- External OAuth (Google, Apple, Kakao, Naver, etc.)\n\nAuthentication journey:\n1. **Registration**: Users can sign up (customer/seller) via email or OAuth; sellers require approval by admin before activation.\n2. **Login**: Users authenticate via their chosen method. Session tokens maintain secure state.\n3. **Role Assignment & Escalation**: Upon login, the backend loads role claims for each user and applies authorization gates accordingly. Seller role changes require audit/approval flow.\n\n### Mermaid Diagram: Login & Registration Flow (Summary)\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n  A[Start] --> B{Choose Login Method}\n  B -->|Email/Password| C[Enter credentials]\n  B -->|OAuth| D[Select OAuth Provider]\n  C --> E[Verify/2FA (opt)]\n  D --> E\n  E --> F{Role Type}\n  F -->|Customer| G[Load Customer Dashboard]\n  F -->|Seller| H{Approval Status}\n  H -->|Approved| I[Load Seller Portal]\n  H -->|Pending| J[Show Pending Notice]\n  F -->|Admin| K[Admin Console]\n```\n\n## 5. User Profile Management\n- Users access self-service portal to edit personal details, change passwords, manage connected accounts, and revoke sessions.\n- Profile contains display name, contact info, addresses, avatar, linked OAuth accounts, and preferences. Sensitive actions require re-authentication.\n\n## 6. Security and Compliance\n- All passwords securely hashed (bcrypt or better)\n- MFA/2FA available for all users (recommended, required for sellers/admins)\n- Access tokens are short-lived; refresh token rotation applied\n- Strict audit logging for role changes, admin operations, sensitive actions\n- GDPR/CCPA compliant consent, data deletion, and export tools integrated\n\n## 7. Role-Based Access Design\n- Each REST API endpoint enforces role-based authorization:\n    - Customers: Purchase, rewards, favorites, orders, personal info (scoped)\n    - Sellers: Product, inventory, analytics, and customer messaging (limited to their catalog)\n    - Administrators: Full management (system-wide)\n- APIs issue JWTs with role and scope claims per session.\n\n## 8. Acceptance Criteria\n- Users can register, upgrade, or revoke their role securely and smoothly\n- All user data updates/operations are logged and auditable\n- Role-restricted endpoints cannot be accessed by unauthorized users\n- Seamless OAuth integration & SSO for all supported providers\n- Compliance and data portability requirements are met\n\n---\n\n[Return to Table of

AI Shopmall – User and Identity Management\n\n## 1. Overview\nThe User and Identity Management system for the AI Shopmall establishes secure, scalable, and user-friendly foundations for all authentication and authorization flows. It defines how customers, sellers, and administrators register, log in, manage their roles, and interact securely with the platform while supporting both traditional and modern (guest, OAuth) authentication methods.\n\n## 2. Objectives\n- Ensure robust and secure identity and access management for all user types\n- Provide seamless and flexible registration/login options, including external OAuth\n- Support role-based permissions and dynamic role escalation/approval flows\n- Centralize user profile and identity data for compliance and personalization\n\n## 3. User Roles\n| Role          | Description                                                                                                                   | Key Permissions                                              |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Customer      | Shopper who browses, purchases, earns rewards, and manages favorites/profile                                                  | Browse, purchase, review, favorite, profile mgmt             |\n| Seller        | Member who lists products, manages inventory, reviews sales analytics, and responds to queries (approval required)            | Product/inventory mgmt, view analytics, reply to customers   |\n| Administrator | Privileged user managing backend, users, products, compliance, analytics, and all system settings                             | All permissions (admin UI, config, compliance, auditing)     |\n\nThe system enforces clear separation between these roles using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). All APIs are protected by relevant role checks.\n\n## 4. User Registration and Login Flows\n**Supported authentication methods:**\n- Standard email/password registration and login\n- Guest access with temporary session profiles\n- External OAuth (Google, Apple, Kakao, Naver, etc.)\n\nAuthentication journey:\n1. **Registration**: Users can sign up (customer/seller) via email or OAuth; sellers require approval by admin before activation.\n2. **Login**: Users authenticate via their chosen method. Session tokens maintain secure state.\n3. **Role Assignment & Escalation**: Upon login, the backend loads role claims for each user and applies authorization gates accordingly. Seller role changes require audit/approval flow.\n\n### Mermaid Diagram: Login & Registration Flow (Summary)\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n  A[Start] --> B{Choose Login Method}\n  B -->|Email/Password| C[Enter credentials]\n  B -->|OAuth| D[Select OAuth Provider]\n  C --> E[Verify/2FA (opt)]\n  D --> E\n  E --> F{Role Type}\n  F -->|Customer| G[Load Customer Dashboard]\n  F -->|Seller| H{Approval Status}\n  H -->|Approved| I[Load Seller Portal]\n  H -->|Pending| J[Show Pending Notice]\n  F -->|Admin| K[Admin Console]\n```\n\n## 5. User Profile Management\n- Users access self-service portal to edit personal details, change passwords, manage connected accounts, and revoke sessions.\n- Profile contains display name, contact info, addresses, avatar, linked OAuth accounts, and preferences. Sensitive actions require re-authentication.\n\n## 6. Security and Compliance\n- All passwords securely hashed (bcrypt or better)\n- MFA/2FA available for all users (recommended, required for sellers/admins)\n- Access tokens are short-lived; refresh token rotation applied\n- Strict audit logging for role changes, admin operations, sensitive actions\n- GDPR/CCPA compliant consent, data deletion, and export tools integrated\n\n## 7. Role-Based Access Design\n- Each REST API endpoint enforces role-based authorization:\n    - Customers: Purchase, rewards, favorites, orders, personal info (scoped)\n    - Sellers: Product, inventory, analytics, and customer messaging (limited to their catalog)\n    - Administrators: Full management (system-wide)\n- APIs issue JWTs with role and scope claims per session.\n\n## 8. Acceptance Criteria\n- Users can register, upgrade, or revoke their role securely and smoothly\n- All user data updates/operations are logged and auditable\n- Role-restricted endpoints cannot be

These principles apply platform-wide for customers, sellers, and administrators, ensuring safe, trustworthy, and legally compliant service operation.\n\n## 1. Business Rules & Acceptable Use\n- Users must comply with local laws, platform terms, and code of conduct.\n- Prohibited behaviors include spamming, fraudulent transactions, unlawful content, and security circumvention.\n- Sellers must ensure product authenticity and provide accurate descriptions.\n- Review moderation is enforced to prevent defamation, abuse, or prohibited advertising.\n\n## 2. Regulatory & Industry Compliance\n- Compliance with personal data regulations (GDPR, CCPA, local laws).\n- Transparent consent for data processing, profiling, analytics, and marketing.\n- Intellectual property and copyright adherence from both platform and users.\n- Support for tax compliance and traceability for commercial transactions.\n\n## 3. Security Policies\n- All data transmissions use strong encryption protocols (e.g., TLS).\n- Regular vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and patching cycles.\n- Secure authentication (multi-factor for sellers/admins; password complexity enforced).\n- Role-based access control to restrict sensitive operations.\n- Incident response plan and breach notification procedures.\n\n## 4. Privacy and Data Protection\n- Limit personal information collection to essential data fields.\n- User consent and preferences are mandatory for data sharing and marketing.\n- Data anonymization for analytics and research whenever possible.\n- Users can access, export, or delete their personal data. See [Data Lifecycles](#data-lifecycle-and-retention).\n\n## 5. Accessibility & Inclusivity\n- UI/UX follows WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines ensuring usability for everyone.\n- Support for assistive devices, clear language, and adjustable displays.\n- Accessibility testing integrated into product releases.\n\n## 6. Audit Logging & Monitoring\n- All financial, authentication, and administrative actions are logged.\n- Logs are immutable, timestamped, and include context for audit investigations.\n- Retention and review policies comply with business and legal requirements.\n- Automated anomaly alerts for critical security events.\n\n## 7. Continuous Compliance Operations\n- Ongoing compliance training for employees and admins.\n- Periodic policy reviews and risk assessments; update on legislative changes.\n- Vendor and third-party integrations undergo due diligence and risk management.\n\n## 8. Data Lifecycle and Retention\n### 8.1 Data Retention Schedules\n- Personal data is retained only as long as required for business or legal obligations, or as authorized by the user.\n- Transactional records (orders, payments) are stored for at least 5 years to meet regulatory, audit, and tax requirements.\n- Session data, temporary logs, and analytics are retained for a maximum of 90 days unless extended by explicit need.\n\n### 8.2 Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation\n- Collect the minimum dataset necessary per purpose or service feature.\n- Regular audits ensure excess or obsolete data is flagged for review and deletion.\n\n### 8.3 Deletion Procedures & Secure Disposal\n- Users can request account and data deletion; all personal data will be purged, except for records required by law (e.g., financial and tax compliance).\n- Automated and manual workflows monitor retention timelines, triggering deletion where applicable.\n- Deleted data is securely destroyed using industry-standard data sanitization techniques, including cryptographic wiping and physical media disposal for backups.\n\n### 8.4 Compliance and Privacy Integration\n- Data lifecycle policies fulfill user rights regarding access, rectification, deletion, and portability.\n- All retention and disposal steps are fully documented and auditable.\n- Business partners and processors are contractually

Security Policies\n- All data transmissions use strong encryption protocols (e.g., TLS).\n- Regular vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and patching cycles.\n- Secure authentication (multi-factor for sellers/admins; password complexity enforced).\n- Role-based access control to restrict sensitive operations.\n- Incident response plan and breach notification procedures.\n\n## 4. Privacy and Data Protection\n- Limit personal information collection to essential data fields.\n- User consent and preferences are mandatory for data sharing and marketing.\n- Data anonymization for analytics and research whenever possible.\n- Users can access, export, or delete their personal data. See [Data Lifecycles](#data-lifecycle-and-retention).\n\n## 5. Accessibility & Inclusivity\n- UI/UX follows WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines ensuring usability for everyone.\n- Support for assistive devices, clear language, and adjustable displays.\n- Accessibility testing integrated into product releases.\n\n## 6. Audit Logging & Monitoring\n- All financial, authentication, and administrative actions are logged.\n- Logs are immutable, timestamped, and include context for audit investigations.\n- Retention and review policies comply with business and legal requirements.\n- Automated anomaly alerts for critical security events.\n\n## 7. Continuous Compliance Operations\n- Ongoing compliance training for employees and admins.\n- Periodic policy reviews and risk assessments; update on legislative changes.\n- Vendor and third-party integrations undergo due diligence and risk management.\n\n## 8. Data Lifecycle and Retention\n### 8.1 Data Retention Schedules\n- Personal data is retained only as long as required for business or legal obligations, or as authorized by the user.\n- Transactional records (orders, payments) are stored for at least 5 years to meet regulatory, audit, and tax requirements.\n- Session data, temporary logs, and analytics are retained for a maximum of 90 days unless extended by explicit need.\n\n### 8.2 Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation\n- Collect the minimum dataset necessary per purpose or service feature.\n- Regular audits ensure excess or obsolete data is flagged for review and deletion.\n\n### 8.3 Deletion Procedures & Secure Disposal\n- Users can request account and data deletion; all personal data will be purged, except for records required by law (e.g., financial and tax compliance).\n- Automated and manual workflows monitor retention timelines, triggering deletion where applicable.\n- Deleted data is securely destroyed using industry-standard data sanitization techniques, including cryptographic wiping and physical media disposal for backups.\n\n### 8.4 Compliance and Privacy Integration\n- Data lifecycle policies fulfill user rights regarding access, rectification, deletion, and portability.\n- All retention and disposal steps are fully documented and auditable.\n- Business partners and processors are contractually obliged to adhere to the same lifecycle and retention

Order, Cart, and Fulfillment System\n\n## Overview\nThe Order, Cart, and Fulfillment System is a foundational set of modules in the AI-powered shopmall. It manages every phase from product selection through checkout, payment processing, shipment, returns, cancellations, and aftersales—while tightly integrated with user/identity, product/inventory, and promotions systems. This document serves as an actionable specification for developers, outlining flows, data models, real-world cases, and relationships with adjacent systems.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- **Cart Management**: Support add/update/delete for single/multiple SKUs, with real-time inventory validation, merging duplicate entries, handling limits (max per order, item, user). Edge cases include out-of-stock changes during shopping and price updates. Error scenarios: stockout at checkout, price changed after carted, exceeding available promo/redemption limits.\n   - Flow: On add-to-cart, system checks [product & inventory] (via `/inventory/check`) for quantity, price, and promotion eligibility, then updates session/user cart. If inventory depletes before checkout, cart shows warning and disables checkout button for that SKU. Example API call: `POST /cart/add {skuId, quantity, userId}`. Response includes updated cart state and warnings if any.\n\n- **Order Placement**: Enables one-click or multi-step checkout, supporting split orders by seller/warehouse, multi-shipping, and address validation. Edge: multi-seller split, different delivery schedules. Error: Address outside delivery area, payment failure, insufficient user role.\n   - Flow: User proceeds to checkout, system locks cart items (invoking `/inventory/lock`). Orders are split per seller for fulfillment, tracking per seller’s SLA. Example: `POST /order/checkout {cartId, addressId, paymentToken}`. State: pending → paid/failed. Errors are returned with failure codes (`OUT_OF_STOCK`, `INVALID_ADDRESS`).\n\n- **Payment Integration**: Connect with payment gateways (cards, wallets, points, rewards). Rollback cart/order on payment failure. Edge: guest checkout with limited payment methods. Includes secure handling of sensitive info.\n   - Pattern: `POST /payment/authorize {orderId, paymentMethod, userId}` → On success, triggers order confirmation, else emits payment error with guidance for next steps.\n\n- **Order Fulfillment & Logistics**: Coordinate with logistics partners (internal/third-party) for each order split, providing tracking, shipping updates, and estimated delivery. Errors: delayed handoff, lost item, nondelivery.\n   - API: `GET /order/status {orderId}` returns current state, per-item tracking number. State updates are pushed to customer and admin dashboards.\n\n- **Returns & Aftersales**: Allow returns, exchanges, or order cancellations before dispatch, handling both auto-approval (by rule) and manual review (operator). Includes fraud checks and auto-reversal of inventory and payment where valid.\n   - Scenario: User requests refund for partial item delivery. System verifies eligibility by status and rules, initiates payment reversal, and updates inventory.\n\n- **Notifications**: Real-time status updates (cart, order, shipment) via email/SMS/push, handled by messaging queue and user preferences.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Performance**: <300ms for key flows (add-to-cart, checkout, order query), aiming for 99.99% uptime. Scalability via stateless APIs, asynchronous job queues for fulfillment events, and hypermedia for order navigation.\n  - *Implementation*: Use CDN for static assets, cache inventory checks, autoscale service pools.\n\n- **Reliability**: ACID compliance on order/payment, distributed transaction management for split/rollback operations. SLAs: 99.99% order integrity, auto alert for failed jobs.\n\n- **Security**: PCI DSS for payment, GDPR compliant on PII, access scoped by user role. Implement rate limiting, anti-fraud, input sanitization.\n\n- **Traceability**: Full audit logs for every cart/order change, searchable by user, item, and timestamp. *Mitigation*: All events signed and timestamped.\n\n- **Testability**: Contract and end-to-end tests automated for each stage—cart, order, payment, fulfillment runs. Include mocks for third-party failures (payment, shipping).\n\n## Relationships to Other Systems\n### Product & Inventory Management ([see details](./03_ai_shopmall_product_and_inventory_management.md))\nThis system interfaces during add-to-cart (inventory, SKU/option mapping), price/finality-lock at checkout, and fulfillment (reserved stock release/conflict resolution). Models include `SKU`, `StockItem` (fields: `id`, `skuId`, `quantity`, `location`, `reservedForOrderId`). Errors include over-reservation (race), stale stock, and system sync failures. All adjustments are idempotent and audit-logged.\n\n### Promotion & Rewards System ([see details](./05_ai_shopmall_promotion_and_rewards_system.md))\nCart and order modules query/apply available promotions per line item or order (coupons, rewards, bundle discounts). Decision logic runs: eligibility (time, user role, inventory), stacking order, and best-benefit computation. On order update/cancel, reverses/adjusts applied promos. Conflict: mutually exclusive offers. Flow: `POST /promotion/apply {cartId, userId}` returns promo deductions, warnings, and affected items.\n\n### User & Identity Management ([see details](./02_ai_shopmall_user_and_identity_management.md))\nAll mutation APIs (cart/order/returns) require authentication scoped by `customer`, `seller`, or `admin` roles. Supports guest checkout (limited features: single-shipment, excludes rewards). Handles fraud/fake-user detection with CAPTCHA, device/fingerprint checks, and transaction velocity rules. Permission failures: API returns `401/403` with audit trail. Users can upgrade account or switch to full registration mid-flow.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Successful add-to-cart for in-stock and permitted SKUs, with error messages for out-of-stock, exceeding limits, and price/promo changes. Automated QA simulates concurrent adds and inventory race conditions.\n- Checkout flow supports split orders, promo application, address validation, and payment success/failure. Tests run for every combination of guest/registered, multiple addresses, and payment fallback cases.\n- Payment completion triggers fulfillment. Negative test: simulate gateway timeout or fraud rejection and check for order compensation.\n- Audit logs capture all changes, accessible and filterable for admins.\n- Order, cart, and fulfillment models and APIs covered by contract and end-to-end tests, with mocks for upstream (inventory, payment, shipping) failures.\n\n## Practical Examples & Flows\n- **Cart Add Example**:\n   - Request: `POST /cart/add {skuId: \"S901\", quantity: 2, userId: \"U123\"}`\n   - System: Validates inventory using `/inventory/check`, applies eligible promotions, and updates cart state.\n   - Response: `{cartId: \"C125\", items: [...], message: \"2 items added. Promotion X applied. Remaining stock: 18.\"}`\n   - Edge: If SKU is OOS, returns `{error: \"OUT_OF_STOCK\"}`\n\n- **Order Checkout Example**:\n   - Request: `POST /order/checkout {cartId, shipping: {...}, paymentToken}`\n   - Flow: System locks inventory, splits order per seller, validates promo, and initiates payment auth. On success, triggers fulfillment; on failure, rolls inventory/promo and returns error.\n\n- **Promo Application Example**:\n   - User applies coupon at checkout. System calls `/promotion/apply`, recalculates total, reverses promo if cart changes, resolves conflicts by business rules (e.g., best discount wins), and logs user/rule/decision.\n

Favorites & Personalization Module\n\n## Overview\nThe Favorites & Personalization module enhances user experience by enabling customers to save, organize, and personalize product and service-related data. Core features include managing favorites across products, addresses, and inquiries, tailoring notifications, and leveraging folders and tags for organization. Advanced personalization is achieved by learning user patterns and suggesting relevant content or promotions.\n\n---\n\n## Objectives\n- Increase user engagement and retention by offering customizable favorites and recommendations.\n- Streamline shopping experiences and repeat purchases.\n- Provide scalable personalization that adapts to various entity types (products, sellers, inquiries, addresses).\n\n---\n\n## User Journeys\n### Scenario 1: Adding and Removing a Favorite (Positive/Negative)\n- **Customer views a product:** The \"Add to Favorites\" button is displayed.\n    - **Step 1:** User taps the button. Confirmation appears, and the product is added to their default favorites folder.\n    - **Step 2:** User receives an optional prompt to categorize the favorite into a custom folder or add tags.\n    - **Negative Path 1:** If not logged in, the system prompts the user to log in or sign up before saving the favorite, with clear error messaging.\n    - **Negative Path 2:** If the favorite already exists in the chosen folder, a non-intrusive message advises the user.\n- **Removing a favorite:**\n    - **Step 1:** User clicks the “Remove from Favorites” icon beside a saved item.\n    - **Step 2:** The item is instantly removed, providing undo feedback.\n    - **Negative Path:** If the item was not found (sync issue), an error message is shown with troubleshooting advice.\n\n### Scenario 2: Notification Preferences (Positive/Negative)\n- **User opens notification settings:** A list of favorite-linked alerts (e.g., price drop, restock, product review response) is displayed.\n    - **Step 1:** User toggles notification types (push, email, SMS).\n    - **Step 2:** User chooses to mute notifications for specific folders.\n    - **Negative Path:** If the system fails to update preferences (connectivity, error), the UI notifies and reverts changes.\n    - **Opt-out case:** User declines all notifications; system respects and confirms their selection.\n\n### Scenario 3: Organizing Favorites in Folders\n- **Step 1:** User creates, renames, or deletes folders.\n- **Step 2:** Favorites are moved between folders by drag-and-drop or bulk selection.\n- **Negative Path:** Trying to delete a folder containing favorites prompts for confirmation; deletion only proceeds if the user selects to either move or delete the contained entries.\n\n---\n\n## Functional Requirements (with examples)\n1. **Add/Remove Favorites**\n    - Users may add any supported entity (product, seller, address, inquiry) to favorites.\n    - Example: Add product #1001 to \"Spring Sale\" folder, tag as \"Gift Idea.\"\n    - Edge: Prevent duplicate entries within the same folder and type.\n2. **Folder & Tag Management**\n    - Users create, rename, or delete folders.\n    - Favorites can be tagged for fast filtering: “Organic”, “Wishlist”, etc.\n    - Example: Move two addresses to \"Holiday List.\"\n3. **Notification Preferences**\n    - Users toggle notification types (push/email/SMS) per favorite or folder.\n    - Muting notifications per item/folder is supported.\n    - Example: Enable push for price drops in “Wishlist”; mute notifications entirely for \"Work Supplies.\"\n4. **Multi-entity Support**\n    - Supported entities: products, sellers, addresses, inquiries (all with unique IDs).\n    - Flows are similar regardless of entity, but metadata varies (e.g., address notes vs. product specs).\n5. **Bulk Actions**\n    - Select multiple entries to move, tag, or delete in a single operation.\n    - Example: Bulk-remove 10 old favorites.\n\n---\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Security**\n    - Favorites data is encrypted at rest and in transit (AES-256/TLS 1.3+).\n    - Role-based access ensures users manage only their own favorites.\n    - GDPR compliance: Favorite lists and logs exportable as downloadable files; users can request deletion per GDPR \"right to be forgotten.\"\n- **Performance**\n    - All actions complete in <500ms for up to 5,000 favorites per user.\n- **Reliability**\n    - Bulk operations are transactional: partial failures auto-rollback.\n- **Logging & Audit**\n    - All access/changes logged with user ID, timestamp, IP.\n    - Unauthorized or failed attempts are monitored and audited.\n\n---\n\n## Data Model & ERD\n### Entities\n- **User** (`user_id`): Owner of favorites and folders.\n- **Favorite** (`favorite_id`, `entity_type`, `entity_id`, `folder_id`, `user_id`, `tags`, `created_at`): Maps user to item or entity.\n- **Folder** (`folder_id`, `user_id`, `name`): Used to group favorites; can be default or user-created.\n- **NotificationPreference** (`preference_id`, `user_id`, `target_id`, `target_type`, `notif_types_enabled`): Stores delivery types and scope (item/folder/all).\n\n### Relationships\n- One user has multiple folders; each folder is unique per user.\n- One favorite belongs to one folder but can carry multiple tags.\n- Notification preferences can be scoped to either favorite or folder (distinguished by `target_type`).\n\n### Sample Data Table\n| user_id | favorite_id | entity_type | entity_id | folder_id | tags        | created_at           |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------------------|\n| 55      | 101         | product     | 1001      | 900       | \"gift, eco\" | 2025-07-21T10:05:00Z |\n| 55      | 102         | address     | 458       | 901       | \"home\"      | 2025-07-21T13:22:00Z |\n\n### ERD (Mermaid)\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n    USER ||--o{ FOLDER : owns\n    USER ||--o{ NOTIFICATIONPREFERENCE : \"sets\"\n    FOLDER ||--o{ FAVORITE : holds\n    FAVORITE }o--|| NOTIFICATIONPREFERENCE : \"triggers\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria (including edge cases)\n- ✅ User can add/remove any supported entity to favorites when logged in.\n- ✅ User cannot favorite or organize items if not logged in (system prompts for login).\n- ✅ No duplicate favorites within same folder/entity.\n- ✅ User can decline or customize notifications for any favorite or folder.\n- ✅ Attempting to remove a non-existent or already-removed favorite returns a user-visible error.\n- ✅ Folders cannot be deleted if containing favorites without explicit user confirmation.\n- ✅ Favorites data remains private per user; unauthorized access attempts are denied and logged.\n- ✅ Bulk actions properly handle partial errors with rollback and messaging.\n- ✅ GDPR requests for data access/export or erasure are fulfilled within 30 days.\n- ✅ Notifications are not sent more than once per state change (e.g., avoid duplicate alerts).\n- ✅ Role permissions: only the owning user and admins (when permitted) may view or manage a user’s favorites.\n"},"total":33,"completed":24,"step":0,"created_at":"2025-07-22T13:05:45.708Z"},"tokenUsage":{"facade":{"aggregate":{"total":355943,"input":{"total":333167,"cached":11520},"output":{"total":22776,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":355943,"input":{"total":333167,"cached":11520},"output":{"total":22776,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"analyze":{"aggregate":{"total":332983,"input":{"total":311506,"cached":11520},"output":{"total":21477,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":332983,"input":{"total":311506,"cached":11520},"output":{"total":21477,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"prisma":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"interface":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"test":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"realize":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_predic

(`favorite_id`, `entity_type`, `entity_id`, `folder_id`, `user_id`, `tags`, `created_at`): Maps user to item or entity.\n- **Folder** (`folder_id`, `user_id`, `name`): Used to group favorites; can be default or user-created.\n- **NotificationPreference** (`preference_id`, `user_id`, `target_id`, `target_type`, `notif_types_enabled`): Stores delivery types and scope (item/folder/all).\n\n### Relationships\n- One user has multiple folders; each folder is unique per user.\n- One favorite belongs to one folder but can carry multiple tags.\n- Notification preferences can be scoped to either favorite or folder (distinguished by `target_type`).\n\n### Sample Data Table\n| user_id | favorite_id | entity_type | entity_id | folder_id | tags        | created_at           |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------------------|\n| 55      | 101         | product     | 1001      | 900       | \"gift, eco\" |

edge cases)\n- ✅ User can add/remove any supported entity to favorites when logged in.\n- ✅ User cannot favorite or organize items if not logged in (system prompts for login).\n- ✅ No duplicate favorites within same folder/entity.\n- ✅ User can decline or customize notifications for any favorite or folder.\n- ✅ Attempting to remove a non-existent or already-removed favorite returns a user-visible error.\n- ✅ Folders cannot be deleted if containing favorites without explicit user confirmation.\n- ✅ Favorites data remains private per user; unauthorized access attempts are denied and logged.\n- ✅ Bulk actions properly handle partial errors with rollback and messaging.\n- ✅ GDPR requests for data access/export or erasure are fulfilled within 30 days.\n- ✅ Notifications are not sent more than once per state change (e.g., avoid duplicate alerts).\n- ✅ Role permissions: only the owning user and admins (when permitted) may view or manage a user’s favorites.\n"},"total":33,"completed":25,"step":0,"created_at":"2025-07-22T13:05:51.696Z"},"tokenUsage":{"facade":{"aggregate":{"total":369433,"input":{"total":346522,"cached":11520},"output":{"total":22911,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":369433,"input":{"total":346522,"cached":11520},"output":{"total":22911,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"analyze":{"aggregate":{"total":346473,"input":{"total":324861,"cached":11520},"output":{"total":21612,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":346473,"input":{"total":324861,"cached":11520},"output":{"total":21612,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"prisma":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"interface":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"test":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"realize":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_predic

Order, Cart, and Fulfillment System\n\n## Overview\nThe Order, Cart, and Fulfillment System is a foundational set of modules in the AI-powered shopmall. It manages every phase from product selection through checkout, payment processing, shipment, returns, cancellations, and aftersales—while tightly integrated with user/identity, product/inventory, and promotions systems. This document serves as an actionable specification for developers, outlining flows, data models, real-world cases, and relationships with adjacent systems.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- **Cart Management**: Support add/update/delete for single/multiple SKUs, with real-time inventory validation, merging duplicate entries, handling limits (max per order, item, user). Edge cases include out-of-stock changes during shopping and price updates. Error scenarios: stockout at checkout, price changed after carted, exceeding available promo/redemption limits.\n   - Flow: On add-to-cart, system checks [product & inventory] (via `/inventory/check`) for quantity, price, and promotion eligibility, then updates session/user cart. If inventory depletes before checkout, cart shows warning and disables checkout button for that SKU. Example API call: `POST /cart/add {skuId, quantity, userId}`. Response includes updated cart state and warnings if any.\n\n- **Order Placement**: Enables one-click or multi-step checkout, supporting split orders by seller/warehouse, multi-shipping, and address validation. Edge: multi-seller split, different delivery schedules. Error: Address outside delivery area, payment failure, insufficient user role.\n   - Flow: User proceeds to checkout, system locks cart items (invoking `/inventory/lock`). Orders are split per seller for fulfillment, tracking per seller’s SLA. Example: `POST /order/checkout {cartId, addressId, paymentToken}`. State: pending → paid/failed. Errors are returned with failure codes (`OUT_OF_STOCK`, `INVALID_ADDRESS`).\n\n- **Payment Integration**: Connect with payment gateways (cards, wallets, points, rewards). Rollback cart/order on payment failure. Edge: guest checkout with limited payment methods. Includes secure handling of sensitive info.\n   - Pattern: `POST /payment/authorize {orderId, paymentMethod, userId}` → On success, triggers order confirmation, else emits payment error with guidance for next steps.\n\n- **Order Fulfillment & Logistics**: Coordinate with logistics partners (internal/third-party) for each order split, providing tracking, shipping updates, and estimated delivery. Errors: delayed handoff, lost item, nondelivery.\n   - API: `GET /order/status {orderId}` returns current state, per-item tracking number. State updates are pushed to customer and admin dashboards.\n\n- **Returns & Aftersales**: Allow returns, exchanges, or order cancellations before dispatch, handling both auto-approval (by rule) and manual review (operator). Includes fraud checks and auto-reversal of inventory and payment where valid.\n   - Scenario: User requests refund for partial item delivery. System verifies eligibility by status and rules, initiates payment reversal, and updates inventory.\n\n- **Notifications**: Real-time status updates (cart, order, shipment) via email/SMS/push, handled by messaging queue and user preferences.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Performance**: <300ms for key flows (add-to-cart, checkout, order query), aiming for 99.99% uptime. Scalability via stateless APIs, asynchronous job queues for fulfillment events, and hypermedia for order navigation.\n  - *Implementation*: Use CDN for static assets, cache inventory checks, autoscale service pools.\n\n- **Reliability**: ACID compliance on order/payment, distributed transaction management for split/rollback operations. SLAs: 99.99% order integrity, auto alert for failed jobs.\n\n- **Security**: PCI DSS for payment, GDPR compliant on PII, access scoped by user role. Implement rate limiting, anti-fraud, input sanitization.\n\n- **Traceability**: Full audit logs for every cart/order change, searchable by user, item, and timestamp. *Mitigation*: All events signed and timestamped.\n\n- **Testability**: Contract and end-to-end tests automated for each stage—cart, order, payment, fulfillment runs. Include mocks for third-party failures (payment, shipping).\n\n## Relationships to Other Systems\n### Product & Inventory Management ([see details](./03_ai_shopmall_product_and_inventory_management.md))\nThis system interfaces during add-to-cart (inventory, SKU/option mapping), price/finality-lock at checkout, and fulfillment (reserved stock release/conflict resolution). Models include `SKU`, `StockItem` (fields: `id`, `skuId`, `quantity`, `location`, `reservedForOrderId`). Errors include over-reservation (race), stale stock, and system sync failures. All adjustments are idempotent and audit-logged.\n\n### Promotion & Rewards System ([see details](./05_ai_shopmall_promotion_and_rewards_system.md))\nCart and order modules query/apply available promotions per line item or order (coupons, rewards, bundle discounts). Decision logic runs: eligibility (time, user role, inventory), stacking order, and best-benefit computation. On order update/cancel, reverses/adjusts applied promos. Conflict: mutually exclusive offers. Flow: `POST /promotion/apply {cartId, userId}` returns promo deductions, warnings, and affected items.\n\n### User & Identity Management ([see details](./02_ai_shopmall_user_and_identity_management.md))\nAll mutation APIs (cart/order/returns) require authentication scoped by `customer`, `seller`, or `admin` roles. Supports guest checkout (limited features: single-shipment, excludes rewards). Handles fraud/fake-user detection with CAPTCHA, device/fingerprint checks, and transaction velocity rules. Permission failures: API returns `401/403` with audit trail. Users can upgrade account or switch to full registration mid-flow.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Successful add-to-cart for in-stock and permitted SKUs, with error messages for out-of-stock, exceeding limits, and price/promo changes. Automated QA simulates concurrent adds and inventory race conditions.\n- Checkout flow supports split orders, promo application, address validation, and payment success/failure. Tests run for every combination of guest/registered, multiple addresses, and payment fallback cases.\n- Payment completion triggers fulfillment. Negative test: simulate gateway timeout or fraud rejection and check for order compensation.\n- Audit logs capture all changes, accessible and filterable for admins.\n- Order, cart, and fulfillment models and APIs covered by contract and end-to-end tests, with mocks for upstream (inventory, payment, shipping) failures.\n\n## Practical Examples & Flows\n- **Cart Add Example**:\n   - Request: `POST /cart/add {skuId: \"S901\", quantity: 2, userId: \"U123\"}`\n   - System: Validates inventory using `/inventory/check`, applies eligible promotions, and updates cart state.\n   - Response: `{cartId: \"C125\", items: [...], message: \"2 items added. Promotion X applied. Remaining stock: 18.\"}`\n   - Edge: If SKU is OOS, returns `{error: \"OUT_OF_STOCK\"}`\n\n- **Order Checkout Example**:\n   - Request: `POST /order/checkout {cartId, shipping: {...}, paymentToken}`\n   - Flow: System locks inventory, splits order per seller, validates promo, and initiates payment auth. On success, triggers fulfillment; on failure, rolls inventory/promo and returns error.\n\n- **Promo Application Example**:\n   - User applies coupon at checkout. System calls `/promotion/apply`, recalculates total, reverses promo if cart changes, resolves conflicts by business rules (e.g., best discount wins), and logs user/rule/decision.\n

Overview\nThe User and Identity Management system for the AI Shopmall establishes secure, scalable, and user-friendly foundations for all authentication and authorization flows. It defines how customers, sellers, and administrators register, log in, manage their roles, and interact securely with the platform while supporting both traditional and modern (guest, OAuth) authentication methods.\n\n## 2. Objectives\n- Ensure robust and secure identity and access management for all user types\n- Provide seamless and flexible registration/login options, including external OAuth\n- Support role-based permissions and dynamic role escalation/approval flows\n- Centralize user profile and identity data for compliance and personalization\n\n## 3. User Roles\n| Role          | Description                                                                                                                   | Key Permissions                                              |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Customer      | Shopper who browses, purchases, earns rewards, and manages favorites/profile                                                  | Browse, purchase, review, favorite, profile mgmt             |\n| Seller        | Member who lists products, manages inventory, reviews sales analytics, and responds to queries (approval required)            | Product/inventory mgmt, view analytics, reply to customers   |\n| Administrator | Privileged user managing backend, users, products, compliance, analytics, and all system settings                             | All permissions (admin UI, config, compliance, auditing)     |\n\nThe system enforces clear separation between these roles using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). All APIs are protected by relevant role checks.\n\n## 4. User Registration and Login Flows\n**Supported authentication methods:**\n- Standard email/password registration and login\n- Guest access with temporary session profiles\n- External OAuth (Google, Apple, Kakao, Naver, etc.)\n\nAuthentication journey:\n1. **Registration**: Users can sign up (customer/seller) via email or OAuth; sellers require approval by admin before activation.\n2. **Login**: Users authenticate via their chosen method. Session tokens maintain secure state.\n3. **Role Assignment & Escalation**: Upon login, the backend loads role claims for each user and applies authorization gates accordingly. Seller role changes require audit/approval flow.\n\n### Mermaid Diagram: Login & Registration Flow (Summary)\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n  A[Start] --> B{Choose Login Method}\n  B -->|Email/Password| C[Enter credentials]\n  B -->|OAuth| D[Select OAuth Provider]\n  C --> E[Verify/2FA (opt)]\n  D --> E\n  E --> F{Role Type}\n  F -->|Customer| G[Load Customer Dashboard]\n  F -->|Seller| H{Approval Status}\n  H -->|Approved| I[Load Seller Portal]\n  H -->|Pending| J[Show Pending Notice]\n  F -->|Admin| K[Admin Console]\n```\n\n## 5. User Profile Management\n- Users access self-service portal to edit personal details, change passwords, manage connected accounts, and revoke sessions.\n- Profile contains display name, contact info, addresses, avatar, linked OAuth accounts, and preferences. Sensitive actions require re-authentication.\n\n## 6. Security and Compliance\n- All passwords securely hashed (bcrypt or better)\n- MFA/2FA available for all users (recommended, required for sellers/admins)\n- Access tokens are short-lived; refresh token rotation applied\n- Strict audit logging for role changes, admin operations, sensitive actions\n- GDPR/CCPA compliant consent, data deletion, and export tools integrated\n\n## 7. Role-Based Access Design\n- Each REST API endpoint enforces role-based authorization:\n    - Customers: Purchase, rewards, favorites, orders, personal info (scoped)\n    - Sellers: Product, inventory, analytics, and customer messaging (limited to their catalog)\n    - Administrators: Full management (system-wide)\n- APIs issue JWTs with role and scope claims per session.\n\n## 8. Acceptance Criteria\n- Users can register, upgrade, or revoke their role securely and smoothly\n- All user data updates/operations are logged and auditable\n- Role-restricted endpoints cannot be accessed by unauthorized users\n- Seamless OAuth integration & SSO for all supported providers\n- Compliance and data portability requirements are met\n\n---\n\n[Return to Table of Contents](./00_ai_shopmall_toc.md)\n","03_ai_shopmall_product_and_inventory_management.md":"# AI Shopmall – Product & Inventory Management\n\n---\n\n## 1.

It manages every phase from product selection through checkout, payment processing, shipment, returns, cancellations, and aftersales—while tightly integrated with user/identity, product/inventory, and promotions systems. This document serves as an actionable specification for developers, outlining flows, data models, real-world cases, and relationships with adjacent systems.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- **Cart Management**: Support add/update/delete for single/multiple SKUs, with real-time inventory validation, merging duplicate entries, handling limits (max per order, item, user). Edge cases include out-of-stock changes during shopping and price updates. Error scenarios: stockout at checkout, price changed after carted, exceeding available promo/redemption limits.\n   - Flow: On add-to-cart, system checks [product & inventory] (via `/inventory/check`) for quantity, price, and promotion eligibility, then updates session/user cart. If inventory depletes before checkout, cart shows warning and disables checkout button for that SKU. Example API call: `POST /cart/add {skuId, quantity, userId}`. Response includes updated cart state and warnings if any.\n\n- **Order Placement**: Enables one-click or multi-step checkout, supporting split orders by seller/warehouse, multi-shipping, and address validation. Edge: multi-seller split, different delivery schedules. Error: Address outside delivery area, payment failure, insufficient user role.\n   - Flow: User proceeds to checkout, system locks cart items (invoking `/inventory/lock`). Orders are split per seller for fulfillment, tracking per seller’s SLA. Example: `POST /order/checkout {cartId, addressId, paymentToken}`. State: pending → paid/failed. Errors are returned with failure codes (`OUT_OF_STOCK`, `INVALID_ADDRESS`).\n\n- **Payment Integration**: Connect with payment gateways (cards, wallets, points, rewards). Rollback cart/order on payment failure. Edge: guest checkout with limited payment methods. Includes secure handling of sensitive info.\n   - Pattern: `POST /payment/authorize {orderId, paymentMethod, userId}` → On success, triggers order confirmation, else emits payment error with guidance for next steps.\n\n- **Order Fulfillment & Logistics**: Coordinate with logistics partners (internal/third-party) for each order split, providing tracking, shipping updates, and estimated delivery. Errors: delayed handoff, lost item, nondelivery.\n   - API: `GET /order/status {orderId}` returns current state, per-item tracking number. State updates are pushed to customer and admin dashboards.\n\n- **Returns & Aftersales**: Allow returns, exchanges, or order cancellations before dispatch, handling both auto-approval (by rule) and manual review (operator). Includes fraud checks and auto-reversal of inventory and payment where valid.\n   - Scenario: User requests refund for partial item delivery. System verifies eligibility by status and rules, initiates payment reversal, and updates inventory.\n\n- **Notifications**: Real-time status updates (cart, order, shipment) via email/SMS/push, handled by messaging queue and user preferences.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Performance**: <300ms for key flows (add-to-cart, checkout, order query), aiming for 99.99% uptime. Scalability via stateless APIs, asynchronous job queues for fulfillment events, and hypermedia for order navigation.\n  - *Implementation*: Use CDN for static assets, cache inventory checks, autoscale service pools.\n\n- **Reliability**: ACID compliance on order/payment, distributed transaction management for split/rollback operations. SLAs: 99.99% order integrity, auto alert for failed jobs.\n\n- **Security**: PCI DSS for payment, GDPR compliant on PII, access scoped by user role. Implement rate limiting, anti-fraud, input sanitization.\n\n- **Traceability**: Full audit logs for every cart/order change, searchable by user, item, and timestamp. *Mitigation*: All events signed and timestamped.\n\n- **Testability**: Contract and end-to-end tests automated for each stage—cart, order, payment, fulfillment runs. Include mocks for third-party failures (payment, shipping).\n\n## Relationships to Other Systems\n### Product & Inventory Management ([see details](./03_ai_shopmall_product_and_inventory_management.md))\nThis system interfaces during add-to-cart (inventory, SKU/option mapping), price/finality-lock at checkout, and fulfillment (reserved stock release/conflict resolution). Models include `SKU`, `StockItem` (fields: `id`, `skuId`, `quantity`, `location`, `reservedForOrderId`). Errors include over-reservation (race), stale stock, and system sync failures. All adjustments are idempotent and audit-logged.\n\n### Promotion & Rewards System ([see details](./05_ai_shopmall_promotion_and_rewards_system.md))\nCart and order modules query/apply available promotions per line item or order (coupons, rewards, bundle discounts). Decision logic runs: eligibility (time, user role, inventory), stacking order, and best-benefit computation. On order update/cancel, reverses/adjusts applied promos. Conflict: mutually exclusive offers. Flow: `POST /promotion/apply {cartId, userId}` returns promo deductions, warnings, and affected items.\n\n### User & Identity Management ([see details](./02_ai_shopmall_user_and_identity_management.md))\nAll mutation APIs (cart/order/returns) require authentication scoped by `customer`, `seller`, or `admin` roles. Supports guest checkout (limited features: single-shipment, excludes rewards). Handles fraud/fake-user detection with CAPTCHA, device/fingerprint checks, and transaction velocity rules. Permission failures: API returns `401/403` with audit trail. Users can upgrade account or switch to full registration mid-flow.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Successful add-to-cart for in-stock and permitted SKUs, with error messages for out-of-stock, exceeding limits, and price/promo changes. Automated QA simulates concurrent adds and inventory race conditions.\n- Checkout flow supports split orders, promo application, address validation, and payment success/failure. Tests run for every combination of guest/registered, multiple addresses, and payment fallback cases.\n- Payment completion triggers fulfillment. Negative test: simulate gateway timeout or fraud rejection and check for order compensation.\n- Audit logs capture all changes, accessible and filterable for admins.\n- Order, cart, and fulfillment models and APIs covered by contract and end-to-end tests, with mocks for upstream (inventory, payment, shipping) failures.\n\n## Practical Examples & Flows\n- **Cart Add Example**:\n   - Request: `POST /cart/add {skuId: \"S901\", quantity: 2, userId: \"U123\"}`\n   - System: Validates inventory using `/inventory/check`, applies eligible promotions, and updates cart state.\n   - Response: `{cartId: \"C125\", items: [...], message: \"2 items added. Promotion X applied. Remaining stock: 18.\"}`\n   - Edge: If SKU is OOS, returns `{error: \"OUT_OF_STOCK\"}`\n\n- **Order Checkout Example**:\n   - Request: `POST /order/checkout {cartId, shipping: {...}, paymentToken}`\n   - Flow: System locks inventory, splits order per seller, validates promo, and initiates payment auth. On success, triggers fulfillment; on failure, rolls inventory/promo and returns error.\n\n- **Promo Application Example**:\n   - User applies coupon at checkout. System calls `/promotion/apply`, recalculates total, reverses promo if cart changes, resolves conflicts by business rules (e.g., best discount wins), and logs user/rule/decision.\n   \n---","05_ai_shopmall_promotion_and_rewards_system.md":"# Promotion and Rewards System Plan\n\n## 1.

Core features include managing favorites across products, addresses, and inquiries, tailoring notifications, and leveraging folders and tags for organization. Advanced personalization is achieved by learning user patterns and suggesting relevant content or promotions.\n\n---\n\n## Objectives\n- Increase user engagement and retention by offering customizable favorites and recommendations.\n- Streamline shopping experiences and repeat purchases.\n- Provide scalable personalization that adapts to various entity types (products, sellers, inquiries, addresses).\n\n---\n\n## User Journeys\n### Scenario 1: Adding and Removing a Favorite (Positive/Negative)\n- **Customer views a product:** The \"Add to Favorites\" button is displayed.\n    - **Step 1:** User taps the button. Confirmation appears, and the product is added to their default favorites folder.\n    - **Step 2:** User receives an optional prompt to categorize the favorite into a custom folder or add tags.\n    - **Negative Path 1:** If not logged in, the system prompts the user to log in or sign up before saving the favorite, with clear error messaging.\n    - **Negative Path 2:** If the favorite already exists in the chosen folder, a non-intrusive message advises the user.\n- **Removing a favorite:**\n    - **Step 1:** User clicks the “Remove from Favorites” icon beside a saved item.\n    - **Step 2:** The item is instantly removed, providing undo feedback.\n    - **Negative Path:** If the item was not found (sync issue), an error message is shown with troubleshooting advice.\n\n### Scenario 2: Notification Preferences (Positive/Negative)\n- **User opens notification settings:** A list of favorite-linked alerts (e.g., price drop, restock, product review response) is displayed.\n    - **Step 1:** User toggles notification types (push, email, SMS).\n    - **Step 2:** User chooses to mute notifications for specific folders.\n    - **Negative Path:** If the system fails to update preferences (connectivity, error), the UI notifies and reverts changes.\n    - **Opt-out case:** User declines all notifications; system respects and confirms their selection.\n\n### Scenario 3: Organizing Favorites in Folders\n- **Step 1:** User creates, renames, or deletes folders.\n- **Step 2:** Favorites are moved between folders by drag-and-drop or bulk selection.\n- **Negative Path:** Trying to delete a folder containing favorites prompts for confirmation; deletion only proceeds if the user selects to either move or delete the contained entries.\n\n---\n\n## Functional Requirements (with examples)\n1. **Add/Remove Favorites**\n    - Users may add any supported entity (product, seller, address, inquiry) to favorites.\n    - Example: Add product #1001 to \"Spring Sale\" folder, tag as \"Gift Idea.\"\n    - Edge: Prevent duplicate entries within the same folder and type.\n2. **Folder & Tag Management**\n    - Users create, rename, or delete folders.\n    - Favorites can be tagged for fast filtering: “Organic”, “Wishlist”, etc.\n    - Example: Move two addresses to \"Holiday List.\"\n3. **Notification Preferences**\n    - Users toggle notification types (push/email/SMS) per favorite or folder.\n    - Muting notifications per item/folder is supported.\n    - Example: Enable push for price drops in “Wishlist”; mute notifications entirely for \"Work Supplies.\"\n4. **Multi-entity Support**\n    - Supported entities: products, sellers, addresses, inquiries (all with unique IDs).\n    - Flows are similar regardless of entity, but metadata varies (e.g., address notes vs. product specs).\n5. **Bulk Actions**\n    - Select multiple entries to move, tag, or delete in a single operation.\n    - Example: Bulk-remove 10 old favorites.\n\n---\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Security**\n    - Favorites data is encrypted at rest and in transit (AES-256/TLS 1.3+).\n    - Role-based access ensures users manage only their own favorites.\n    - GDPR compliance: Favorite lists and logs exportable as downloadable files; users can request deletion per GDPR \"right to be forgotten.\"\n- **Performance**\n    - All actions complete in <500ms for up to 5,000 favorites per user.\n- **Reliability**\n    - Bulk operations are transactional: partial failures auto-rollback.\n- **Logging & Audit**\n    - All access/changes logged with user ID, timestamp, IP.\n    - Unauthorized or failed attempts are monitored and audited.\n\n---\n\n## Data Model & ERD\n### Entities\n- **User** (`user_id`): Owner of favorites and folders.\n- **Favorite** (`favorite_id`, `entity_type`, `entity_id`, `folder_id`, `user_id`, `tags`, `created_at`): Maps user to item or entity.\n- **Folder** (`folder_id`, `user_id`, `name`): Used to group favorites; can be default or user-created.\n- **NotificationPreference** (`preference_id`, `user_id`, `target_id`, `target_type`, `notif_types_enabled`): Stores delivery types and scope (item/folder/all).\n\n### Relationships\n- One user has multiple folders; each folder is unique per user.\n- One favorite belongs to one folder but can carry multiple tags.\n- Notification preferences can be scoped to either favorite or folder (distinguished by `target_type`).\n\n### Sample Data Table\n| user_id | favorite_id | entity_type | entity_id | folder_id | tags        | created_at           |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------------------|\n| 55      | 101         | product     | 1001      | 900       | \"gift, eco\" | 2025-07-21T10:05:00Z |\n| 55      | 102         | address     | 458       | 901       | \"home\"      | 2025-07-21T13:22:00Z |\n\n### ERD (Mermaid)\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n    USER ||--o{ FOLDER : owns\n    USER ||--o{ NOTIFICATIONPREFERENCE : \"sets\"\n    FOLDER ||--o{ FAVORITE : holds\n    FAVORITE }o--|| NOTIFICATIONPREFERENCE : \"triggers\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria (including edge cases)\n- ✅ User can add/remove any supported entity to favorites when logged in.\n- ✅ User cannot favorite or organize items if not logged in (system prompts for login).\n- ✅ No duplicate favorites within same folder/entity.\n- ✅ User can decline or customize notifications for any favorite or folder.\n- ✅ Attempting to remove a non-existent or already-removed favorite returns a user-visible error.\n- ✅ Folders cannot be deleted if containing favorites without explicit user confirmation.\n- ✅ Favorites data remains private per user; unauthorized access attempts are denied and logged.\n- ✅ Bulk actions properly handle partial errors with rollback and messaging.\n- ✅ GDPR requests for data access/export or erasure are fulfilled within 30 days.\n- ✅ Notifications are not sent more than once per state change (e.g., avoid duplicate alerts).\n- ✅ Role permissions: only the owning user and admins (when permitted) may view or manage a user’s favorites.\n","09_ai_shopmall_extensibility_and_system_structure.md":"# AI Shopmall Extensibility & System Structure\n\n## Overview\nThe AI Shopmall platform is designed as a modular, scalable, and highly extensible commerce solution. This document outlines the core extensibility strategies, section and channel structures, attachment/file management, and system architecture patterns. It is intended to guide ongoing system enhancements and seamless third-party integrations while maintaining robust performance and security.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Extensibility Principles\n- **API-First Orientation:** The Shopmall exposes functionality via secure RESTful APIs and offers GraphQL endpoints for advanced integrations. All core modules (users, inventory, order, content) are accessible and extensible.\n- **Plugin/Module Architecture:** The core system supports dynamic loading of feature modules (e.g., payment gateways, analytics, AI-recommendation widgets) with defined extension points.\n- **Channel & Sectionization:** Business logic and UI/UX can be partitioned into channels (e.g., web, mobile, in-store kiosk) and functional sections (e.g., product list, cart, admin). Each channel/section can override or extend base behaviors with minimal coupling.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Integration Model\n- **Third-Party Apps and APIs:**\n  - OAuth 2.0 with granular scopes for secure external access\n  - Webhooks for event-driven integration (e.g., order/payment/shipment notifications)\n  - API rate limiting & throttling to ensure platform stability\n- **Attachment & File Handling:**\n  - Secure upload/download APIs for product images, manuals, reviews\n  - Role-based access: customers, sellers, and admins each have scoped file privileges\n  - Version control for attachments to prevent stale assets\n\n---\n\n## 3. Performance & Scalability\n- **Horizontal Scaling:** Stateless service design combined with distributed queue systems enables scaling across multiple nodes and regions.\n- **Caching Strategies:** Multi-layered cache (in-memory, distributed) for public sections, with cache invalidation hooks on product/update triggers.\n- **Asynchronous Processing:** Heavy tasks (bulk imports, image processing, analytics) are offloaded to task queues and processed asynchronously.\n- **Monitoring & Auto-Healing:** Integration with real-time monitoring (APM, logs, alerts) and auto-recovery mechanisms minimize downtime.\n\n---\n\n## 4. System Structure Diagram\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Web/Mobile/Kiosk Channels] -->|API Calls| B{API Gateway}\n    B --> C[Core Shopmall Services]\n    C --> D1[User Module]\n    C --> D2[Inventory Module]\n    C --> D3[Order & Cart Module]\n    C --> D4[Content & Review Module]\n    C --> E[Plugin/Extension Loader]\n    E --> F1[3rd-Party Apps]\n    E --> F2[Custom Widgets]\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Extensibility Roadmap & Guidelines\n- **Future-Proofing:** All new APIs and extension points must be backward compatible and strictly versioned\n- **Documentation:** Public and internal interfaces are documented with OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas and kept up-to-date\n- **Security:** All extensibility mechanisms (plugins, APIs, files) undergo regular security audits and enforce principle of least privilege.\n\n---\n\n## References\n- [01_ai_shopmall_system_overview.md](./01_ai_shopmall_system_overview.md)\n- [03_ai_shopmall_product_and_inventory_management.md](./03_ai_shopmall_product_and_inventory_management.md)\n- [10_ai_shopmall_rules_security_and_compliance.md](./10_ai_shopmall_rules_security_and_compliance.md)\n","10_ai_shopmall_rules_security_and_compliance.md":"# AI Shopmall Rules, Security, and Compliance\n\n## Overview\nThis document defines the business rules, regulatory requirements, security standards, data privacy obligations, accessibility guidelines, and audit procedures for the AI Shopmall platform.
