AI Mall Architecture and Extensibility\n\n## Overview\nThis document describes the architectural principles and extensibility features of the AI Mall system. It explains how the platform is designed for scalability, modularity, and the ability to integrate new channels, categories, and sections. Additionally, it covers file/attachment management, API gateway strategies, and the adoption of a microservices approach to ensure that the AI Mall evolves efficiently and reliably as business requirements or technologies change.\n\n## 1. Architectural Principles\n- **Modularity:** All business domains and features are defined as modules with standardized interfaces for easy maintenance and deployment.\n- **Channel & Section Abstraction:** Sales channels (web, mobile app, third-party platforms) and sections (specialty areas within channels) are designed to be added or reconfigured without impacting core systems.\n- **Category Flexibility:** Products and content are organized into dynamic, hierarchical categories, allowing expansion or reclassification as inventory evolves.\n- **Extensible APIs:** API endpoints are exposed via a gateway, ensuring easy onboarding of new channels, integrations, or partners.\n- **Data Consistency:** Shared data models and contract-driven development are applied across services to maintain consistency as the system expands.\n\n## 2. Extending Channels, Sections, and Categories\n- **Channels:** Each channel is configured with metadata (brand, domain, UI settings) and can be enabled/disabled dynamically. Merchants can request or launch new channels through an admin interface.\n- **Sections:** Sections segment channel experiences (e.g., lifestyle, electronics), each defined by configurable rules, permissions, and featured content.\n- **Category Management:** Categories use a tree structure, supporting drag-and-drop reordering, merging, and bulk actions from the admin UI. Category metadata is versioned for auditability.\n\n## 3. File and Attachment Handling\n- **File Service:** Attachments (product images, manuals, promotions) are managed through a file service supporting large file uploads, inline previews, and automatic media optimization.\n- **Access Control:** Roles (admin, seller, customer) are enforced for file visibility and manipulation. Expiring download links provide secure delivery for sensitive files.\n- **Storage Backends:** The architecture accommodates multiple storage providers—cloud or on-premises—using interchangeable adapters.\n\n## 4. API Gateway Integration\n- **Unified API Entry:** All traffic (internal/external) flows through a gateway, providing consistent authentication, throttling, and protocol translation.\n- **Routing Rules:** Channel and section-specific logic is abstracted at the gateway level, enabling fast onboarding or deprecation of endpoints.\n- **Developer Portal:** API documentation and sandbox environments support partners extending or integrating with AI Mall.\n\n## 5. Microservice Architecture\n- **Loose Coupling:** Business capabilities are isolated as services (orders, catalog, personalization, search) communicating through matured APIs or asynchronous events.\n- **Scalable Deployment:** Each microservice can be scaled, updated, or replaced independently to suit evolving workloads or technical advances.\n- **Service Registration:** Services declare their capabilities and dependencies consistently through a centralized registry.\n\n## 6. Modularity and Future-Proofing\n- **Plug-in Framework:** Optional modules (e.g., new payment gateways, analytics providers) can be registered with minimal friction.\n- **Configuration-Driven Behavior:** Behavioral changes (UI, business rules, feature toggles) are managed via configuration, reducing redeployment needs.\n- **Upgrade Path:** Robust documentation, versioning policies, and

Security, Compliance, and Accessibility\n\n## Overview\nThis document provides a comprehensive guide to the security architecture, compliance standards, audit logging, privacy, and accessible/internationalized UI/UX design for the AI-Mall platform. These frameworks ensure the platform is secure, meets regulatory requirements, maintains user privacy, and is accessible and usable by all users globally.\n\n## 1. Security Architecture\n- **Identity & Access Management:** All API endpoints are protected with robust authentication (OAuth2, JWT). Role-based access (customer, seller, admin) restricts operations to only the necessary functionalities per user type.\n- **Data Protection:** Data-in-transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2+. All sensitive data (PII, payment, credentials) is encrypted at rest using AES-256 or equivalent industry standards.\n- **Service Segmentation:** Use of microservices ensures isolation between checkout, user management, and analytics. Least privilege is applied for communications.\n- **Network Security:** Separation of public/private subnets, strict firewall rules, DDoS protection, and regular external/internal security scans.\n- **API Security:** Strict input validation, rate limiting, and anti-CSRF/XSS/SQL injection shields.\n- **Incident Response:** Defined process for security breach notification, automated security monitoring, and rapid response mechanisms with a post-mortem process.\n\n## 2. Compliance Matrix\n| Standard/Regulation     | Relevant Modules                | Key Requirements & Approach                                                               |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| GDPR                   | All data handling               | User consent management, right to access/erasure, data minimization, Data Processing Agreements |\n| PCI DSS                | Payments                        | Card data never stored post-authorization, network segmentation, regular audits, tokenization         |\n| e-Commerce Law (KR/US/EU) | Entire platform                | Electronic transactions certification, customer protections, returns, and dispute handling        |\n| Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)| Front-end                       | Perceivable, operable, understandable, robust content; ARIA roles and keyboard navigation         |\n\n## 3. Audit Logging and Privacy\n- **Comprehensive Audit Trails:** All critical actions (login, product changes, financial transactions, permission assignments) are logged with immutable logs, storing timestamps, actor, and action type.\n- **Anonymization & Retention:** Logs and analytics are pseudonymized; retention periods are transparently communicated and controlled in line with local laws.\n- **Privacy by Design:** Privacy impact assessments are performed for every release; default settings favor minimal data collection and sharing.\n- **User Controls:** Users can export, review, and request erasure of their personal data through dedicated UI flows.\n\n## 4. Accessible and Internationalized UI/UX\n- **Globalization:** Full multilingual UI (starting with English, Korean, and Japanese), locale-aware formatting for currency, numbers, and dates.\n- **Accessibility Features:** Follows WCAG 2.1 Level AA—semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, high-contrast options, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, alternative text for graphics.\n- **Continuous Testing:** Regular accessibility and localization reviews, with direct input from users and stakeholders.\n\n## 5. Acceptance Criteria\n- No unauthorized access is possible across tenant boundaries or privileged operations.\n- Platform passes independent penetration, compliance, and accessibility audits.\n- Documentation and audit logs available for all regulatory and data subject requests.\n- All new features undergo security, privacy, and accessibility reviews prior to release.\n\nIs there anything else to refine or expand in this

AI Mall Cart and Order Processing\n\n## Overview\nThis document details the cart management, checkout, and intelligent order processing flows for the AI Mall platform, with a focus on user experience, payment logic, fulfillment processes, and integration of AI-powered features such as dynamic recommendations, risk analysis, and fraud detection. It defines processes, business rules, and acceptance criteria for seamless operation, addressing requirements for all user roles.\n\n## Objectives\n- Provide efficient, intuitive cart and checkout experience for customers.\n- Support multi-seller, session-persistent carts for complex purchase scenarios.\n- Enable flexible, secure order processing including diverse payment methods.\n- Integrate AI-driven recommendations, upselling, and fraud detection mechanisms.\n- Ensure sellers and admins can manage orders and fulfillment robustly.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n### 1. Cart Management\n- Customers may create, update, and remove items in persistent carts (browser and cross-device).\n- Real-time validation of inventory, dynamic pricing, and discount eligibility.\n- Auto-sync cart contents between anonymous and authenticated sessions upon login.\n- Multi-seller checkouts support: distinct fulfillment per seller.\n\n### 2. Checkout & Payment Processing\n- Streamlined checkout flow with address validation, shipping options, and payment aggregation.\n- Support for multiple payment gateways, loyalty/reward points, and promotions.\n- AI-powered upsell/cross-sell suggestions during checkout.\n- Secure payment tokenization and PCI-compliant data flow.\n\n### 3. Order Creation & Fulfillment\n- Order split logic for multi-seller carts; unique order IDs for each seller.\n- Optional AI delivery estimate and dynamic shipping offer calculation.\n- Sellers access real-time order dashboards and fulfillment management tools.\n- Automated notifications for order status (placed, accepted, shipped, delivered).\n\n### 4. Intelligent Fraud Detection & Risk Analysis\n- AI models screen order risk pre-payment and post-order for suspicious activity.\n- Admin receives risk-scored alerts and can trigger manual review or hold.\n- Integration with external fraud/threat detection APIs as needed.\n\n### 5. User Roles & Permissions\n- Customers access only their own carts, order history, and checkout.\n- Sellers can only view/manage their own product orders.\n- Admins have full access to all orders, intervention, and override capability.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- Session resilience (cart restoration on reconnect, crash recovery).\n- High concurrency support for flash sales/events.\n- GDPR/CCPA compliant data management for all checkout/payment flows.\n- System and process audit logs for order/payment events.\n\n## Key Acceptance Criteria\n- Customers can recover carts seamlessly across devices and sessions.\n- Payments process securely with minimal friction and error handling.\n- Multi-seller orders are split correctly with separate fulfillment flows.\n- AI-based fraud prevention demonstrates effective detection with measurable reduction in false positives and chargebacks.\n- Order status updates trigger appropriate notifications and UI changes.\n\n## Example User Flow (Customer Perspective)\n1. Add products (from multiple sellers) to cart.\n2. Cart dynamically updates prices, validates stock, and displays tailored recommendations.\n3. User initiates checkout → chooses address, selects shipping/payment method.\n4. AI module offers personalized deals (discounts, bundles).\n5. Order is screened: low-risk proceeds, high-risk may require additional authentication.\n6. Orders are split by seller, processed individually.\n7. Payment processed; confirmation and expected delivery provided.\n\n## Data Model Summary (Logical View)\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n    CART ||--|{ CART_ITEM : contains\n    CART_ITEM }|--|| PRODUCT :

Security, Compliance, and Accessibility\n\n## Overview\nThis document provides a comprehensive guide to the security architecture, compliance standards, audit logging, privacy, and accessible/internationalized UI/UX design for the AI-Mall platform. These frameworks ensure the platform is secure, meets regulatory requirements, maintains user privacy, and is accessible and usable by all users globally.\n\n## 1. Security Architecture\n- **Identity & Access Management:** All API endpoints are protected with robust authentication (OAuth2, JWT). Role-based access (customer, seller, admin) restricts operations to only the necessary functionalities per user type.\n- **Data Protection:** Data-in-transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2+. All sensitive data (PII, payment, credentials) is encrypted at rest using AES-256 or equivalent industry standards.\n- **Service Segmentation:** Use of microservices ensures isolation between checkout, user management, and analytics. Least privilege is applied for communications.\n- **Network Security:** Separation of public/private subnets, strict firewall rules, DDoS protection, and regular external/internal security scans.\n- **API Security:** Strict input validation, rate limiting, and anti-CSRF/XSS/SQL injection shields.\n- **Incident Response:** Defined process for security breach notification, automated security monitoring, and rapid response mechanisms with a post-mortem process.\n\n## 2. Compliance Matrix\n| Standard/Regulation     | Relevant Modules                | Key Requirements & Approach                                                               |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| GDPR                   | All data handling               | User consent management, right to access/erasure, data minimization, Data Processing Agreements |\n| PCI DSS                | Payments                        | Card data never stored post-authorization, network segmentation, regular audits, tokenization         |\n| e-Commerce Law (KR/US/EU) | Entire platform                | Electronic transactions certification, customer protections, returns, and dispute handling        |\n| Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)| Front-end                       | Perceivable, operable, understandable, robust content; ARIA roles and keyboard navigation         |\n\n## 3. Audit Logging and Privacy\n- **Comprehensive Audit Trails:** All critical actions (login, product changes, financial transactions, permission assignments) are logged with immutable logs, storing timestamps, actor, and action type.\n- **Anonymization & Retention:** Logs and analytics are pseudonymized; retention periods are transparently communicated and controlled in line with local laws.\n- **Privacy by Design:** Privacy impact assessments are performed for every release; default settings favor minimal data collection and sharing.\n- **User Controls:** Users can export, review, and request erasure of their personal data through dedicated UI flows.\n\n## 4. Accessible and Internationalized UI/UX\n- **Globalization:** Full multilingual UI (starting with English, Korean, and Japanese), locale-aware formatting for currency, numbers, and dates.\n- **Accessibility Features:** Follows WCAG 2.1 Level AA—semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, high-contrast options, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, alternative text for graphics.\n- **Continuous Testing:** Regular accessibility and localization reviews, with direct input from users and stakeholders.\n\n## 5. Acceptance Criteria\n- No unauthorized access is possible across tenant boundaries or privileged operations.\n- Platform passes independent penetration, compliance, and accessibility audits.\n- Documentation and audit logs available for all regulatory and data subject requests.\n- All new features undergo security, privacy, and accessibility reviews prior to release.\n\nIs there anything else to refine or expand in this document?"},"review":"The document \"09_ai-mall_security-compliance-accessibility.md\" contains sufficient detail, is well-organized, and covers all major aspects of security, compliance, audit logging, privacy, and accessibility as outlined.

Product and Content Management\n\n## Overview\n\nThis document details the design, requirements, and functional flow of the Product and Content Management system for AI Mall. It covers the entire product lifecycle, catalog organization, content management, advanced search/SEO, option and variant handling, and AI-powered product intelligence. The scope ensures all user types (customer, seller, admin) experience seamless management and interaction with the catalog, while supporting scalability and extensibility.\n\n## 1. Objectives\n- Enable robust product catalog management for thousands of items across multiple categories.\n- Streamline workflow for product creation, editing, publication, and archival.\n- Support rich product content (images, videos, descriptions) with SEO optimization.\n- Facilitate advanced variant/option modeling (e.g., color, size, bundles).\n- Offer AI-powered recommendations and product analytics.\n- Maintain role-based access and data integrity.\n\n## 2. User Personas\n- **Customer:** Browses, searches, and filters products. Relies on rich content and reviews for decisions. Interacts with AI features for personalization.\n- **Seller:** Manages products, variants, inventory, images, and content. Reviews analytics to optimize offerings. Uses AI insights for merchandising.\n- **Admin:** Oversees end-to-end product operations. Approves listings, manages categories/attributes, audits content and compliance.\n\n## 3. Product Lifecycle & Catalog Structure\n- Flexible category/taxonomy management with unlimited levels (parent/child, custom categories).\n- Product status states: Draft, Under Review, Published, Archived.\n- Intelligent attribute system: category-specific, global (e.g., brand, material, tags).\n- Bulk import/export for large-scale updates via CSV/excel APIs.\n- Approval workflows (admin review before publication).\n\n## 4. Content Management & SEO\n- Multiple image/gallery uploads, video support, rich text editing (WYSIWYG for descriptions/specs).\n- Metadata & structured schema (OpenGraph, Twitter Card, JSON-LD for SEO).\n- Editable meta title/description, slug, alt-tags, canonical URLs.\n- AI assistance for auto-generating product descriptions, translation, and keyword suggestions.\n\n## 5. Variants & Options\n- Support for multi-dimensional SKUs (e.g., size/color/material).\n- Pricing, stock, and content per variant.\n- Customizable option sets with validation.\n- Easy duplication/template tools for repeated configurations.\n\n## 6. AI-Powered Intelligence\n- Automated product tagging and categorization.\n- Dynamic recommendations (cross-sell, up-sell, similar items).\n- Visual search for image-based product discovery.\n- Demand/sales analytics (e.g., top products, trend alerts).\n\n## 7. Non-Functional Requirements\n- High availability and performance for catalog searches and updates.\n- Strong data consistency and validation.\n- Role-based access control as defined in [02_ai-mall_user-roles-and-management.md](./02_ai-mall_user-roles-and-management.md).\n- Audit log for all add/edit/delete operations by sellers and admins.\n- Compliance with security and accessibility policies ([09_ai-mall_security-compliance-accessibility.md](./09_ai-mall_security-compliance-accessibility.md)).\n\n## 8.

Intelligent Fraud Detection & Risk Analysis\n- AI models screen order risk pre-payment and post-order for suspicious activity.\n- Admin receives risk-scored alerts and can trigger manual review or hold.\n- Integration with external fraud/threat detection APIs as needed.\n\n### 5. User Roles & Permissions\n- Customers access only their own carts, order history, and checkout.\n- Sellers can only view/manage their own product orders.\n- Admins have full access to all orders, intervention, and override capability.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- Session resilience (cart restoration on reconnect, crash recovery).\n- High concurrency support for flash sales/events.\n- GDPR/CCPA compliant data management for all checkout/payment flows.\n- System and process audit logs for order/payment events.\n\n## Key Acceptance Criteria\n- Customers can recover carts seamlessly across devices and sessions.\n- Payments process securely with minimal friction and error handling.\n- Multi-seller orders are split correctly with separate fulfillment flows.\n- AI-based fraud prevention demonstrates effective detection with measurable reduction in false positives and chargebacks.\n- Order status updates trigger appropriate notifications and UI changes.\n\n## Example User Flow (Customer Perspective)\n1. Add products (from multiple sellers) to cart.\n2. Cart dynamically updates prices, validates stock, and displays tailored recommendations.\n3. User initiates checkout → chooses address, selects shipping/payment method.\n4. AI module offers personalized deals (discounts, bundles).\n5. Order is screened: low-risk proceeds, high-risk may require additional authentication.\n6. Orders are split by seller, processed individually.\n7.

Sellers require verification before storefront activation; admins enforce policy compliance.\n- **User State Management**: All accounts maintain states (active, suspended, pending verification, deleted). Admins have override privileges.\n- **Role Transitions & Upgrades**: Transition flows (e.g., customer→seller) require approval, background verification, and possible re-authentication. Admin grants/revokes are tracked for audit compliance.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Security, Compliance & Data Access\n- **API Authentication & Role Enforcement**: JWTs/OAuth2 tokens encapsulate the `role` claim; API gates all requests based on the active role and permissions matrix.\n- **Sensitive Operations & Audit Trails**: All role elevation, user suspensions, and policy violations are logged and auditable. Access to sensitive endpoints (user data exports, admin tools) is restricted by role and context.\n- **Compliance**: Data protection and privacy are maintained as per regional/Jurisdictional requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Admin actions are auditable; user rights to access, modify, or delete personal data are surfaced via secure endpoints.\n\n---\n\nRefer to other system design files ([TOC](./00_ai-mall_toc.md)) for

AI Mall Architecture and Extensibility\n\n## Overview\nThis document describes the architectural principles and extensibility features of the AI Mall system. It explains how the platform is designed for scalability, modularity, and the ability to integrate new channels, categories, and sections. Additionally, it covers file/attachment management, API gateway strategies, and the adoption of a microservices approach to ensure that the AI Mall evolves efficiently and reliably as business requirements or technologies change.\n\n## 1. Architectural Principles\n- **Modularity:** All business domains and features are defined as modules with standardized interfaces for easy maintenance and deployment.\n- **Channel & Section Abstraction:** Sales channels (web, mobile app, third-party platforms) and sections (specialty areas within channels) are designed to be added or reconfigured without impacting core systems.\n- **Category Flexibility:** Products and content are organized into dynamic, hierarchical categories, allowing expansion or reclassification as inventory evolves.\n- **Extensible APIs:** API endpoints are exposed via a gateway, ensuring easy onboarding of new channels, integrations, or partners.\n- **Data Consistency:** Shared data models and contract-driven development are applied across services to maintain consistency as the system expands.\n\n## 2. Extending Channels, Sections, and Categories\n- **Channels:** Each channel is configured with metadata (brand, domain, UI settings) and can be enabled/disabled dynamically. Merchants can request or launch new channels through an admin interface.\n- **Sections:** Sections segment channel experiences (e.g., lifestyle, electronics), each defined by configurable rules, permissions, and featured content.\n- **Category Management:** Categories use a tree structure, supporting drag-and-drop reordering, merging, and bulk actions from the admin UI. Category metadata is versioned for auditability.\n\n## 3. File and Attachment Handling\n- **File Service:** Attachments (product images, manuals, promotions) are managed through a file service supporting large file uploads, inline previews, and automatic media optimization.\n- **Access Control:** Roles (admin, seller, customer) are enforced for file visibility and manipulation. Expiring download links provide secure delivery for sensitive files.\n- **Storage Backends:** The architecture accommodates multiple storage providers—cloud or on-premises—using interchangeable adapters.\n\n## 4. API Gateway Integration\n- **Unified API Entry:** All traffic (internal/external) flows through a gateway, providing consistent authentication, throttling, and protocol translation.\n- **Routing Rules:** Channel and section-specific logic is abstracted at the gateway level, enabling fast onboarding or deprecation of endpoints.\n- **Developer Portal:** API documentation and sandbox environments support partners extending or integrating with AI Mall.\n\n## 5. Microservice Architecture\n- **Loose Coupling:** Business capabilities are isolated as services (orders, catalog, personalization, search) communicating through matured APIs or asynchronous events.\n- **Scalable Deployment:** Each microservice can be scaled, updated, or replaced independently to suit evolving workloads or technical advances.\n- **Service Registration:** Services declare their capabilities and dependencies consistently through a centralized registry.\n\n## 6. Modularity and Future-Proofing\n- **Plug-in Framework:** Optional modules (e.g., new payment gateways, analytics providers) can be registered with minimal friction.\n- **Configuration-Driven Behavior:** Behavioral changes (UI, business rules, feature toggles) are managed via configuration, reducing redeployment needs.\n- **Upgrade Path:** Robust documentation, versioning policies, and backward compatibility ensure safe upgrades and integration of future AI-driven features.\n\n---\n\n**See also:** [06_ai-mall_interaction-and-personalization.md](./06_ai-mall_interaction-and-personalization.md), [08_ai-mall_ai-and-advanced-analytics.md](./08_ai-mall_ai-and-advanced-analytics.md)\n"},"review":"The document \"07_ai-mall_architecture-and-extensibility.md\" appears to be robust in both volume and coverage.

Security, Compliance, and Accessibility\n\n## Overview\nThis document provides a comprehensive guide to the security architecture, compliance standards, audit logging, privacy, and accessible/internationalized UI/UX design for the AI-Mall platform. These frameworks ensure the platform is secure, meets regulatory requirements, maintains user privacy, and is accessible and usable by all users globally.\n\n## 1. Security Architecture\n- **Identity & Access Management:** All API endpoints are protected with robust authentication (OAuth2, JWT). Role-based access (customer, seller, admin) restricts operations to only the necessary functionalities per user type.\n- **Data Protection:** Data-in-transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2+. All sensitive data (PII, payment, credentials) is encrypted at rest using AES-256 or equivalent industry standards.\n- **Service Segmentation:** Use of microservices ensures isolation between checkout, user management, and analytics. Least privilege is applied for communications.\n- **Network Security:** Separation of public/private subnets, strict firewall rules, DDoS protection, and regular external/internal security scans.\n- **API Security:** Strict input validation, rate limiting, and anti-CSRF/XSS/SQL injection shields.\n- **Incident Response:** Defined process for security breach notification, automated security monitoring, and rapid response mechanisms with a post-mortem process.\n\n## 2. Compliance Matrix\n| Standard/Regulation     | Relevant Modules                | Key Requirements & Approach                                                               |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| GDPR                   | All data handling               | User consent management, right to access/erasure, data minimization, Data Processing Agreements |\n| PCI DSS                | Payments                        | Card data never stored post-authorization, network segmentation, regular audits, tokenization         |\n| e-Commerce Law (KR/US/EU) | Entire platform                | Electronic transactions certification, customer protections, returns, and dispute handling        |\n| Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)| Front-end                       | Perceivable, operable, understandable, robust content; ARIA roles and keyboard navigation         |\n\n## 3. Audit Logging and Privacy\n- **Comprehensive Audit Trails:** All critical actions (login, product changes, financial transactions, permission assignments) are logged with immutable logs, storing timestamps, actor, and action type.\n- **Anonymization & Retention:** Logs and analytics are pseudonymized; retention periods are transparently communicated and controlled in line with local laws.\n- **Privacy by Design:** Privacy impact assessments are performed for every release; default settings favor minimal data collection and sharing.\n- **User Controls:** Users can export, review, and request erasure of their personal data through dedicated UI flows.\n\n## 4. Accessible and Internationalized UI/UX\n- **Globalization:** Full multilingual UI (starting with English, Korean, and Japanese), locale-aware formatting for currency, numbers, and dates.\n- **Accessibility Features:** Follows WCAG 2.1 Level AA—semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, high-contrast options, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, alternative text for graphics.\n- **Continuous Testing:** Regular accessibility and localization reviews, with direct input from users and stakeholders.\n\n## 5. Acceptance Criteria\n- No unauthorized access is possible across tenant boundaries or privileged operations.\n- Platform passes independent penetration, compliance, and accessibility audits.\n- Documentation and audit logs available for all regulatory and data subject requests.\n- All new features undergo security, privacy, and accessibility reviews prior to release.\n\nIs there anything else to refine or expand in this

AI Mall: User Roles & Management\n\n## Overview\nAI Mall incorporates a robust user management system, recognizing three primary roles: Customer, Seller, and Admin. Each role has carefully structured permissions, access scopes, and security measures, ensuring compliance, operational efficiency, and an optimal user experience. This document describes each role in detail, maps their functional boundaries, and outlines user management best practices for the development team.\n\n---\n\n## 1. User Role Definitions\n\n| Role    | Description                                                                                                                                               |\n|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Customer| End-users who browse, purchase products, manage orders/carts, provide reviews/queries, and personalize their experience using AI-driven features.        |\n| Seller  | Merchants managing storefronts, product catalogues, inventory, order fulfillment, analytics, and communications, leveraging AI-based merchant tools.     |\n| Admin   | Platform operators with global access to manage users, content, analytics, compliance, approval workflows, and oversee all AI-powered system functions.  |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

User Lifecycle & Management Flows\n- **Registration & Authentication**: All roles support OAuth, email/password, and multi-factor authentication (configurable per client security policy). API-level role claims are enforced after every authentication event.\n- **Profile Management**: Users can view and edit personal or business profiles within bounds determined by their role. Sellers require verification before storefront activation; admins enforce policy compliance.\n- **User State Management**: All accounts maintain states (active, suspended, pending verification, deleted). Admins have override privileges.\n- **Role Transitions & Upgrades**: Transition flows (e.g., customer→seller) require approval, background verification, and possible re-authentication. Admin grants/revokes are tracked for audit compliance.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Security, Compliance & Data Access\n- **API Authentication & Role Enforcement**: JWTs/OAuth2 tokens encapsulate the `role` claim; API gates all requests based on the active role and permissions matrix.\n- **Sensitive Operations & Audit Trails**: All role elevation, user suspensions, and policy violations are logged and auditable. Access to sensitive endpoints (user data exports, admin tools) is restricted by role and context.\n- **Compliance**: Data protection and privacy are maintained as per regional/Jurisdictional requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Admin actions are auditable; user rights to access, modify, or delete personal data are surfaced via secure endpoints.\n\n---\n\nRefer to other system design files ([TOC](./00_ai-mall_toc.md)) for further architectural or technical expansion on user authentication or system extensibility.\n"},"review":"The document \"02_ai-mall_user-roles-and-management.md\" is sufficiently detailed, exceeding 4,700 characters and providing clear sectioning and comprehensive system design for AI Mall user roles and management.

Security Architecture\n- **Identity & Access Management:** All API endpoints are protected with robust authentication (OAuth2, JWT). Role-based access (customer, seller, admin) restricts operations to only the necessary functionalities per user type.\n- **Data Protection:** Data-in-transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2+. All sensitive data (PII, payment, credentials) is encrypted at rest using AES-256 or equivalent industry standards.\n- **Service Segmentation:** Use of microservices ensures isolation between checkout, user management, and analytics. Least privilege is applied for communications.\n- **Network Security:** Separation of public/private subnets, strict firewall rules, DDoS protection, and regular external/internal security scans.\n- **API Security:** Strict input validation, rate limiting, and anti-CSRF/XSS/SQL injection shields.\n- **Incident Response:** Defined process for security breach notification, automated security monitoring, and rapid response mechanisms with a post-mortem process.\n\n## 2. Compliance Matrix\n| Standard/Regulation     | Relevant Modules                | Key Requirements & Approach                                                               |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| GDPR                   | All data handling               | User consent management, right to access/erasure, data minimization, Data Processing Agreements |\n| PCI DSS                | Payments                        | Card data never stored post-authorization, network segmentation, regular audits, tokenization         |\n| e-Commerce Law (KR/US/EU) | Entire platform                | Electronic transactions certification, customer protections, returns, and dispute handling        |\n| Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)| Front-end                       | Perceivable, operable, understandable, robust content; ARIA roles and keyboard navigation         |\n\n## 3. Audit Logging and Privacy\n- **Comprehensive Audit Trails:** All critical actions (login, product changes, financial transactions, permission assignments) are logged with immutable logs, storing timestamps, actor, and action type.\n- **Anonymization & Retention:** Logs and analytics are pseudonymized; retention periods are transparently communicated and controlled in line with local laws.\n- **Privacy by Design:** Privacy impact assessments are performed for every release; default settings favor minimal data collection and sharing.\n- **User Controls:** Users can export, review, and request erasure of their personal data through dedicated UI flows.\n\n## 4. Accessible and Internationalized UI/UX\n- **Globalization:** Full multilingual UI (starting with English, Korean, and Japanese), locale-aware formatting for currency, numbers, and dates.\n- **Accessibility Features:** Follows WCAG 2.1 Level AA—semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, high-contrast options, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, alternative text for graphics.\n- **Continuous Testing:** Regular accessibility and localization reviews, with direct input from users and stakeholders.\n\n## 5. Acceptance Criteria\n- No unauthorized access is possible across tenant boundaries or privileged operations.\n- Platform passes independent penetration, compliance, and accessibility audits.\n- Documentation and audit logs available for all regulatory and data subject requests.\n- All new features undergo security, privacy, and accessibility reviews prior to release.\n\nIs there anything else to refine or expand in this document?"},"review":"The document under review (`09_ai-mall_security-compliance-accessibility.md`) appears comprehensive, well-structured, and sufficiently detailed for developer handoff.

AI Mall Architecture and Extensibility\n\n## Overview\nThis document describes the architectural principles and extensibility features of the AI Mall system. It explains how the platform is designed for scalability, modularity, and the ability to integrate new channels, categories, and sections. Additionally, it covers file/attachment management, API gateway strategies, and the adoption of a microservices approach to ensure that the AI Mall evolves efficiently and reliably as business requirements or technologies change.\n\n## 1. Architectural Principles\n- **Modularity:** All business domains and features are defined as modules with standardized interfaces for easy maintenance and deployment.\n- **Channel & Section Abstraction:** Sales channels (web, mobile app, third-party platforms) and sections (specialty areas within channels) are designed to be added or reconfigured without impacting core systems.\n- **Category Flexibility:** Products and content are organized into dynamic, hierarchical categories, allowing expansion or reclassification as inventory evolves.\n- **Extensible APIs:** API endpoints are exposed via a gateway, ensuring easy onboarding of new channels, integrations, or partners.\n- **Data Consistency:** Shared data models and contract-driven development are applied across services to maintain consistency as the system expands.\n\n## 2. Extending Channels, Sections, and Categories\n- **Channels:** Each channel is configured with metadata (brand, domain, UI settings) and can be enabled/disabled dynamically. Merchants can request or launch new channels through an admin interface.\n- **Sections:** Sections segment channel experiences (e.g., lifestyle, electronics), each defined by configurable rules, permissions, and featured content.\n- **Category Management:** Categories use a tree structure, supporting drag-and-drop reordering, merging, and bulk actions from the admin UI. Category metadata is versioned for auditability.\n\n## 3. File and Attachment Handling\n- **File Service:** Attachments (product images, manuals, promotions) are managed through a file service supporting large file uploads, inline previews, and automatic media optimization.\n- **Access Control:** Roles (admin, seller, customer) are enforced for file visibility and manipulation. Expiring download links provide secure delivery for sensitive files.\n- **Storage Backends:** The architecture accommodates multiple storage providers—cloud or on-premises—using interchangeable adapters.\n\n## 4. API Gateway Integration\n- **Unified API Entry:** All traffic (internal/external) flows through a gateway, providing consistent authentication, throttling, and protocol translation.\n- **Routing Rules:** Channel and section-specific logic is abstracted at the gateway level, enabling fast onboarding or deprecation of endpoints.\n- **Developer Portal:** API documentation and sandbox environments support partners extending or integrating with AI Mall.\n\n## 5. Microservice Architecture\n- **Loose Coupling:** Business capabilities are isolated as services (orders, catalog, personalization, search) communicating through matured APIs or asynchronous events.\n- **Scalable Deployment:** Each microservice can be scaled, updated, or replaced independently to suit evolving workloads or technical advances.\n- **Service Registration:** Services declare their capabilities and dependencies consistently through a centralized registry.\n\n## 6. Modularity and Future-Proofing\n- **Plug-in Framework:** Optional modules (e.g., new payment gateways, analytics providers) can be registered with minimal friction.\n- **Configuration-Driven Behavior:** Behavioral changes (UI, business rules, feature toggles) are managed via configuration, reducing redeployment needs.\n- **Upgrade Path:** Robust documentation, versioning policies, and backward compatibility ensure safe upgrades and integration of future AI-driven features.\n\n---\n\n**See also:**

AI Mall: User Roles & Management\n\n## Overview\nAI Mall incorporates a robust user management system, recognizing three primary roles: Customer, Seller, and Admin. Each role has carefully structured permissions, access scopes, and security measures, ensuring compliance, operational efficiency, and an optimal user experience. This document describes each role in detail, maps their functional boundaries, and outlines user management best practices for the development team.\n\n---\n\n## 1. User Role Definitions\n\n| Role    | Description                                                                                                                                               |\n|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Customer| End-users who browse, purchase products, manage orders/carts, provide reviews/queries, and personalize their experience using AI-driven features.        |\n| Seller  | Merchants managing storefronts, product catalogues, inventory, order fulfillment, analytics, and communications, leveraging AI-based merchant tools.     |\n| Admin   | Platform operators with global access to manage users, content, analytics, compliance, approval workflows, and oversee all AI-powered system functions.  |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core Permissions Matrix\n\n| Capability                         | Customer | Seller | Admin |\n|-------------------------------------|:--------:|:------:|:-----:|\n| Registration/Sign In/Authentication |    ✓     |   ✓    |   ✓   |\n| Product Browsing/Search/AI Feed     |    ✓     |   ✗    |   ✓   |\n| Manage Own Cart/Order History       |    ✓     |   ✗    |   ✓   |\n| Manage Own Storefront/Products      |    ✗     |   ✓    |   ✓   |\n| Respond To Inquiries/Reviews        |    ✓     |   ✓    |   ✓   |\n| View Analytics                      |    ✗     |   ✓    |   ✓   |\n| System/User Management              |    ✗     |   ✗    |   ✓   |\n| Approvals & Compliance              |    ✗     |   ✗    |   ✓   |\n| Access AI System Configurations     |    ✗     |   ✗    |   ✓   |\n| Participate in Promotions           |    ✓     |   ✓    |   ✓   |\n| Write/Manage Reviews/Inquiries      |    ✓     |   ✓    |   ✓   |\n\n---\n\n## 3. User Lifecycle & Management Flows\n- **Registration & Authentication**: All roles support OAuth, email/password, and multi-factor authentication (configurable per client security policy). API-level role claims are enforced after every authentication event.\n- **Profile Management**: Users can view and edit personal or business profiles within bounds determined by their role. Sellers require verification before storefront activation; admins enforce policy compliance.\n- **User State Management**: All accounts maintain states (active, suspended, pending verification, deleted). Admins have override privileges.\n- **Role Transitions & Upgrades**: Transition flows (e.g., customer→seller) require approval, background verification, and possible re-authentication. Admin grants/revokes are tracked for audit compliance.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Security, Compliance & Data Access\n- **API Authentication & Role Enforcement**: JWTs/OAuth2 tokens encapsulate the `role` claim; API gates all requests based on the active role and permissions matrix.\n- **Sensitive Operations & Audit Trails**: All role elevation, user suspensions, and policy violations are logged and auditable. Access to sensitive endpoints (user data exports, admin tools) is restricted by role and context.\n- **Compliance**: Data protection and privacy are maintained as per regional/Jurisdictional requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Admin actions are auditable; user rights to access, modify, or delete personal data are surfaced via secure endpoints.\n\n---\n\nRefer to other system design files ([TOC](./00_ai-mall_toc.md)) for

User Lifecycle & Management Flows\n- **Registration & Authentication**: All roles support OAuth, email/password, and multi-factor authentication (configurable per client security policy). API-level role claims are enforced after every authentication event.\n- **Profile Management**: Users can view and edit personal or business profiles within bounds determined by their role. Sellers require verification before storefront activation; admins enforce policy compliance.\n- **User State Management**: All accounts maintain states (active, suspended, pending verification, deleted). Admins have override privileges.\n- **Role Transitions & Upgrades**: Transition flows (e.g., customer→seller) require approval, background verification, and possible re-authentication. Admin grants/revokes are tracked for audit compliance.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Security, Compliance & Data Access\n- **API Authentication & Role Enforcement**: JWTs/OAuth2 tokens encapsulate the `role` claim; API gates all requests based on the active role and permissions matrix.\n- **Sensitive Operations & Audit Trails**: All role elevation, user suspensions, and policy violations are logged and auditable. Access to sensitive endpoints (user data exports, admin tools) is restricted by role and context.\n- **Compliance**: Data protection and privacy are maintained as per regional/Jurisdictional requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Admin actions are auditable; user rights to access, modify, or delete personal data are surfaced via secure endpoints.\n\n---\n\nRefer to other system design files ([TOC](./00_ai-mall_toc.md)) for further architectural or technical expansion on user authentication or system extensibility.\n"},"review":"The document (`02_ai-mall_user-roles-and-management.md`) is already comprehensive and well-structured.

AI Mall Architecture and Extensibility\n\n## Overview\nThis document describes the architectural principles and extensibility features of the AI Mall system. It explains how the platform is designed for scalability, modularity, and the ability to integrate new channels, categories, and sections. Additionally, it covers file/attachment management, API gateway strategies, and the adoption of a microservices approach to ensure that the AI Mall evolves efficiently and reliably as business requirements or technologies change.\n\n## 1. Architectural Principles\n- **Modularity:** All business domains and features are defined as modules with standardized interfaces for easy maintenance and deployment.\n- **Channel & Section Abstraction:** Sales channels (web, mobile app, third-party platforms) and sections (specialty areas within channels) are designed to be added or reconfigured without impacting core systems.\n- **Category Flexibility:** Products and content are organized into dynamic, hierarchical categories, allowing expansion or reclassification as inventory evolves.\n- **Extensible APIs:** API endpoints are exposed via a gateway, ensuring easy onboarding of new channels, integrations, or partners.\n- **Data Consistency:** Shared data models and contract-driven development are applied across services to maintain consistency as the system expands.\n\n## 2. Extending Channels, Sections, and Categories\n- **Channels:** Each channel is configured with metadata (brand, domain, UI settings) and can be enabled/disabled dynamically. Merchants can request or launch new channels through an admin interface.\n- **Sections:** Sections segment channel experiences (e.g., lifestyle, electronics), each defined by configurable rules, permissions, and featured content.\n- **Category Management:** Categories use a tree structure, supporting drag-and-drop reordering, merging, and bulk actions from the admin UI. Category metadata is versioned for auditability.\n\n## 3. File and Attachment Handling\n- **File Service:** Attachments (product images, manuals, promotions) are managed through a file service supporting large file uploads, inline previews, and automatic media optimization.\n- **Access Control:** Roles (admin, seller, customer) are enforced for file visibility and manipulation. Expiring download links provide secure delivery for sensitive files.\n- **Storage Backends:** The architecture accommodates multiple storage providers—cloud or on-premises—using interchangeable adapters.\n\n## 4. API Gateway Integration\n- **Unified API Entry:** All traffic (internal/external) flows through a gateway, providing consistent authentication, throttling, and protocol translation.\n- **Routing Rules:** Channel and section-specific logic is abstracted at the gateway level, enabling fast onboarding or deprecation of endpoints.\n- **Developer Portal:** API documentation and sandbox environments support partners extending or integrating with AI Mall.\n\n## 5. Microservice Architecture\n- **Loose Coupling:** Business capabilities are isolated as services (orders, catalog, personalization, search) communicating through matured APIs or asynchronous events.\n- **Scalable Deployment:** Each microservice can be scaled, updated, or replaced independently to suit evolving workloads or technical advances.\n- **Service Registration:** Services declare their capabilities and dependencies consistently through a centralized registry.\n\n## 6. Modularity and Future-Proofing\n- **Plug-in Framework:** Optional modules (e.g., new payment gateways, analytics providers) can be registered with minimal friction.\n- **Configuration-Driven Behavior:** Behavioral changes (UI, business rules, feature toggles) are managed via configuration, reducing redeployment needs.\n- **Upgrade Path:** Robust documentation, versioning policies, and backward compatibility ensure safe upgrades and integration of future AI-driven features.\n\n---\n\n**See also:** [06_ai-mall_interaction-and-personalization.md](./06_ai-mall_interaction-and-personalization.md), [08_ai-mall_ai-and-advanced-analytics.md](./08_ai-mall_ai-and-advanced-analytics.md)\n"},"review":"The document \"07_ai-mall_architecture-and-extensibility.md\" is structured with clear headings covering architecture, extensibility, file/attachment handling, API strategies, and microservices for the AI Mall system.

AI Mall – Promotions and Loyalty Systems\n\n## Overview\nThis document outlines the core features, flows, and requirements for the Promotions and Loyalty Systems of AI Mall. It covers coupon management, loyalty points (mileage), deposit systems, and advanced AI-driven promotional mechanisms. The goal is to enhance customer retention and purchase motivation, providing flexible tools for both sellers and admins to engage shoppers through targeted incentives and dynamic campaigns.\n\n## Objectives\n- Maximize customer lifetime value and retention through dynamic AI-powered promotions\n- Offer flexible coupon and points systems tailored by user behavior and purchase history\n- Provide transparent, robust deposit/refund processes integrated across roles\n- Enable analytics on promotion effectiveness, customer segmentation, and ROI\n\n## Key Features\n- **Coupon Management**: Bulk and single-issue coupons, code-based redemption, auto-assignment, usage analytics, expiration controls\n- **Loyalty Points System (Mileage)**: Earn and burn points on purchases, flexible point issuance policies (fixed, percent-based, event-triggered), points expiry, fraud prevention\n- **Deposit System**: Merchant-driven or user-initiated deposits, use on checkout, instant refunds, payment integrations\n- **AI-Driven Promotions**: Personalization based on demographics, purchase trends, churn risk, inventory status, and buyer segmentation\n- **Promotion Analytics**: Real-time dashboards for redemption rate, uplift, cohort response, and ROI per campaign\n\n## User Scenarios\n### Customer\n- Receives personalized coupon offers via push/email based on shopping habits\n- Accumulates loyalty points on purchases, applies rewards at checkout, views point history\n- Uses deposits seamlessly for quick checkout or receives instant refunds\n\n### Seller\n- Creates limited-time discounts, distributes coupons to loyal or high-risk churn customers using AI recommendations\n- Monitors promotion performance with real-time analytics\n- Manages store-specific deposit and points policies\n\n### Admin\n- Approves system-wide coupon or mileage classes, sets fraud/risk rules\n- Configures global promotion and analytics parameters\n- Oversees bulk coupon events and high-value refunds\n\n## System Requirements\n### Functional\n- Multi-channel coupon distribution (web, mobile, email, push)\n- Stackable and exclusive coupon logic with automatic conflict resolution\n- Customizable earnings/redemption rules for points and deposits\n- Event triggers for AI-driven, behavior-based promotion targeting\n- Full audit logs for issuance, redemption, and cancellation of promotions\n\n### Non-Functional\n- Scalability for peak event loads (e.g., Black Friday, flash sales)\n- Real-time synchronization across all touchpoints\n- Robust fraud detection and anti-abuse mechanisms\n- Secure personal data handling (PII masking, GDPR compliance)\n\n## System Flows\n### Loyalty Points (Mileage)\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n  subgraph EarnPoints\n    A[Purchase Completed] --> B[Points Issuance]\n    B --> C[Points Customer Balance Update]\n  end\n  subgraph BurnPoints\n    D[Checkout Starts] --> E[Points Redemption Option]\n    E --> F[Balance Deducted & Payment Processed]\n  end\n```\n\n### Coupon Lifecycle\n1. Creation: Admin or Seller defines coupon type, value, validity, target group\n2. Distribution: AI segments customers; delivers coupons via preferred channel\n3. Redemption: User applies code or auto-assigns at checkout. Stackability and exclusion rules enforced\n4. Settlement: Discount reflected in order amount; redemption logged for analytics\n5. Expiry/Cancellation: Unused coupons expire or are forcibly cancelled per policy\n\n### Deposit Use and Refund\n- Users add money to deposit account or receive deposits via refunds\n- Applied directly to purchase or future orders\n- Instant return of unused balance upon return/cancellation\n\n## AI-Driven Promotion Examples\n- Personalized “win back” coupon offers for users at risk of churning\n- Inventory-aware flash sales: AI triggers discounts on slow-moving stock\n- Automated loyalty point multipliers on user birthdays or milestones\n\n## KPIs and Analytics\n- Redemption & participation rate per promotion\n- Lift in repeat purchase frequency and average order value\n- Customer lifetime value change attributable to promotions\n- ROI per campaign and behavioral cohort analysis\n\n## References\n- [User Roles & Management](./02_ai-mall_user-roles-and-management.md)\n- [Product and Content Management](./03_ai-mall_product-and-content-management.md)\n- [Architecture & Extensibility](./07_ai-mall_architecture-and-extensibility.md)\n\nIs there anything else to refine or add to this document?"},"review":"This document (05_ai-mall_promotions-and-loyalty-systems.md) is generally well-structured, but to meet delivery standards and fully support developers, it requires the following changes:\n\n1. **Volume Check:** The document is approximately 3,800 characters long, with a relatively high number of headings and subheadings. However, several sections under the headings are concise and would benefit from expansion to reach at least ~5,000 characters and maximize usefulness.\n\n2. **Content Depth:** \n    - Expand explanations and provide at least one concrete example/illustration for each feature under \"Key Features,\" \"User Scenarios,\" and \"System Flows.\"\n    - Under \"Promotion Analytics\" and \"KPIs,\" add more details on analytic methodologies, sample dashboard concepts, and practical usage.\n    - In the \"AI-Driven Promotion Examples,\" add more real-world scenarios, implementation notes, and possible AI model involvement.\n\n3. **Hyperlink Review:**\n    - Three references are listed in \"References\": User Roles & Management, Product and Content Management, and Architecture & Extensibility.\n    - None are self-links or anchor links, so although these files aren't shown as present, you are NOT to request their creation (per reviewer rules), but be sure related concepts (for example, how user roles intersect with the loyalty system) are briefly summarized here, under a new subsection bearing the referenced title, if such summary isn’t already present.\n\n**Instructions:**  \nAnalyze agent, expand the following sections to at least double current content while adding specific, practical examples and technical details within this page, not by referencing other files:\n- Key Features\n- User Scenarios (elaborate each role, add flow diagrams or tables as needed)\n- System Requirements (expand both Functional and Non-Functional)\n- System Flows (provide more narrative and additional diagrams, including failed transactions or edge cases)\n- AI-Driven Promotion Examples (add real use cases, possible data flows)\n- KPIs and Analytics (expand analytic methods, include sample metrics calculations)\n\n**Additional:**  \nFor each reference in \"References,\" add a new subsection under an appropriate heading matching the hyperlink title (e.g., \"User Roles & Management\") and provide a brief summary (3-5 sentences) describing how it relates to promotions and loyalty operations within this document, written within this file.\n\nDo NOT request creation of other documents or pages.

However, for maximal utility for developers, the following improvements are necessary:\n\n1. **Insufficient Volume**:  \n   - The total content is approximately 3,700 characters, which is adequate, but each main heading (“Interaction Modules”, “Personalization Features”, “Moderation & Compliance”) and their subsections are somewhat summarized.  \n   - To ensure solid developer implementation, each subsection (e.g., \"1.1 Inquiries\", \"2.1 Personalized Recommendations\") should be significantly expanded with detailed user stories, edge cases, and sample data flows.\n\n2. **Missing or Underdeveloped Sections**:  \n   - The current document references a preference center for notifications and an optional advanced feature (“collections or wish lists”). These need more detailed usage scenarios and permission implications.\n   - The appendix notes the existence of “User journeys and flow diagrams”, but no such section exists in the text.  \n     → Instruct to add a new section titled \"User Journeys and Flow Diagrams\" under Appendix, providing sample flows for at least one customer and one seller journey.\n\n3. **Moderation & Audit**:  \n   - The moderation and compliance section needs more “how-to” details, i.e., describe example moderation flows, audit log data format, and permission boundaries in greater detail.\n\n4. **Acceptance Criteria & Examples**:  \n   - Expand on \"Acceptance Criteria\" with sample test cases and clearer success/failure scenarios.\n\n**Instructions for the analyze agent**:\n\n- Double the length of each subsection, focusing on implementation details, example payloads, and usage flows.  \n- Add a new subsection under Appendix titled \"User Journeys and Flow Diagrams\" and include a sample journey for both a customer and a seller in narrative or diagrammatic text.\n- For “Moderation & Compliance”, specify typical moderation actions and provide an example of audit log structure.\n- In “Acceptance Criteria”, add sample input/output scenarios and edge cases.\n\nDo not create or reference any external documents.

AI Mall Promotions and Loyalty Systems\n\n## Overview\nThis document outlines the features, operations, requirements, and analytics associated with the AI Mall's promotion and loyalty systems. It covers how promotions, coupons, rewards (mileage/deposit), and advanced AI-driven personalization support business growth and retention. References to user roles, product/content management, and platform extensibility are summarized within relevant sections for developer clarity.\n\n---\n\n## Key Features\n- **Promotion Types**\n  - **Standard Discounts**: Percentage or fixed-amount, scheduled or triggered by events. E.g., Summer Sale (10% off all electronics from July 1-14).\n  - **Coupons**: Single-use, multi-use, stackable or exclusive. E.g., \"WELCOME10\"—new user 10% off, valid for first order only.\n  - **Loyalty Points (Mileage)**: Earned by purchases, can be redeemed on subsequent transactions. E.g., 5 points per $1 spent—customer earns 200 points on a $40 order, redeemable for $2 off next order.\n  - **Deposits**: Store credit from refunds or admin compensation. Can be partial or full, tracked separately from earned rewards.\n  - **Tiered Loyalty Systems**: Customer unlocks Silver, Gold, Platinum levels with increased purchase frequency/amounts, unlocking better rewards or privileges.\n  - **AI-Personalized Offers**: System recommends exclusive promotions based on browsing/buying patterns; e.g., customer interested in outdoor gear gets sent a private \"15% off backpacks\" coupon via in-site notification.\n\n---\n\n## User Scenarios\n| Actor      | Scenario                                                     | Step-by-Step Example |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Customer   | Browses shoes, gets AI-timed pop-up for 5% off coupon. Uses coupon at checkout, and earns 50 points (5 per $1 x $10). Later, sees a loyalty dashboard summarizing rewards and thus returns to shop more. |\n| Seller     | Launches a 'Buy 2 Get 1 Free' campaign via dashboard. Monitors real-time coupon usage analytics and adapts strategy if redemption rates are low (e.g., automatically toggling to free shipping offer). Also sets up product-bundle-exclusive coupons for loyal repeat customers. |\n| Admin      | Sets global holiday discounts, configures coupon stacking rules, adjusts monthly loyalty point multipliers, and receives anomaly alerts if coupon abuse is detected (e.g., by monitoring sudden spikes in redemptions from a single IP address). |\n\n**Sample Flow Diagram** (Customer Loyalty Point Use):\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n  A[Customer checkout] --> B{Eligible for points?}\n  B -- Yes --> C[Assign points]\n  C --> D[Show cumulative points]\n  B -- No --> E[Skip awarding]\n  D --> F[Offer redemption option]\n```\n\n---\n\n## System Requirements\n### Functional\n- Enable admins and sellers to create, edit, and schedule diverse promotions.\n- Auto-apply, personal, and trigger-based promotions (e.g., first purchase, birthday).\n- Allow customers to view rewards/coupon status (dashboard, my page).\n- Coupon validation at checkout (e.g., expiry, usage, stacking rules).\n- Points/deposit application/reversal after returns/refunds.\n- Analytics: Track issuance, usage, and ROI by customer/product/campaign.\n\n### Non-Functional\n- Response time under 2s for coupon validation and loyalty actions.\n- Horizontally scalable rewards ledger and analytics engines to handle high event loads during major sales.\n- Data integrity: transactional consistency between order, reward, and refund records.\n- Role-based access: Only sellers/admins can configure campaigns; customers only claim/use.\n- Compliance with regional promo regulations (e.g., expiry dates, clear display of benefits).\n\n---\n\n## System Flows\n### Example: Coupon Application Failure\nA customer enters a coupon at checkout that is expired. System immediately returns a clear error message, increments a \"bad attempt\" counter (for abuse detection), and suggests valid alternative coupons if available.\n\n### Example: Loyalty Point Redemption Edge Case\nIf customer attempts to redeem more points than their balance, system offers a \"use maximum allowed\" prompt, and logs the attempt for analytics.\n\n**Representative Transaction Flows**\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant C as Customer\n  participant S as System\n  C->>S: Enters coupon code at checkout\n  S-->>C: Validate code, apply if eligible\n  S-->>C: Error if invalid; alternatives if possible\n  C->>S: Selects loyalty points for next order\n  S-->>C: Deduct points, confirm, update dashboard\n```\n\n---\n\n## AI-Driven Promotion Examples\n- **Next Best Offer:** AI identifies a buyer with a high tendency to purchase luxury bags and sends a time-limited 20% coupon only valid for that category. Pattern-matching is based on item views, cart additions, and past successful promotions to similar users.\n- **Churn Prevention:** Detects at-risk users (e.g., 30 days inactivity) and delivers personalized \"Come Back\" bundles combining extra points with an exclusive coupon. Success rate tracked against a baseline group.\n- **A/B Testing:** AI experiments with different discount levels for similar user segments, dynamically promotes most effective offers.\n- **Data Flow Example:**\n  1. Event Stream: User clicks, purchases, coupon redemptions.\n  2. AI Model Input: Event data + user profile\n  3. AI Output: Real-time offer push (notification/email)\n\n---\n\n## KPIs and Analytics\n- **Metrics Calculated:**\n  - Coupon redemption rate (total used / total issued)\n  - Campaign ROI: (`(Additional sales from promotion - cost of discounts)/cost of discounts`)\n  - Repeat purchase rate before and after promotion\n  - Point liability tracking (outstanding/unredeemed)\n- **Analytic Methodologies:** \n  - Time series analysis of redemption and ROI\n  - User cohort segmentation (e.g., by location, age, last activity)\n  - Fraud detection models (flagging bulk or abnormal coupon uses)\n- **Sample Dashboard:**\n  - Line charts of coupon usage by day/category\n  - Heat maps of redemption by user segment\n  - Anomaly alerts on outlier activity\n\n---\n\n## User Roles & Management\nThe loyalty and promotion system depends on robust [User Roles & Management](./02_ai-mall_user-roles-and-management.md). Each feature, from personalization to campaign setup, requires role validation—only sellers and admins launch campaigns, while customers can only claim or redeem. Points, deposits and redemptions are associated with authenticated user profiles, enabling audit trails and fraud controls.\n\n## Product and Content Management\nPromotion applicability depends on [Product and Content Management](./03_ai-mall_product-and-content-management.md). Each promotion or coupon can be restricted to certain categories, brands, or SKUs, ensuring offers align with inventory and marketing goals. Returns, refunds, or bundled promotions require up-to-date catalog data to calculate accurate rewards.\n\n## Architecture & Extensibility\nThe promotion engine is architected to be extensible ([Architecture & Extensibility](./07_ai-mall_architecture-and-extensibility.md)). New reward types, rule engines, and AI models are plug-and-play via module interfaces, and analytics are exportable to external BI tools. Endpoints use secure, scalable APIs, enabling future integration of partner loyalty programs or 3rd-party AI personalization engines.\n\n---"},"total":30,"completed":20,"step":0,"created_at":"2025-07-24T18:59:54.341Z"},"tokenUsage":{"facade":{"aggregate":{"total":475480,"input":{"total":447992,"cached":7680},"output":{"total":27488,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":475480,"input":{"total":447992,"cached":7680},"output":{"total":27488,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"analyze":{"aggregate":{"total":450009,"input":{"total":423973,"cached":7680},"output":{"total":26036,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":450009,"input":{"total":423973,"cached":7680},"output":{"total":26036,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"prisma":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"interface":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"test":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"realize":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_predict

AI Mall Promotions and Loyalty Systems\n\n## Overview\nThis document outlines the features, operations, requirements, and analytics associated with the AI Mall's promotion and loyalty systems. It covers how promotions, coupons, rewards (mileage/deposit), and advanced AI-driven personalization support business growth and retention. References to user roles, product/content management, and platform extensibility are summarized within relevant sections for developer clarity.\n\n---\n\n## Key Features\n- **Promotion Types**\n  - **Standard Discounts**: Percentage or fixed-amount, scheduled or triggered by events. E.g., Summer Sale (10% off all electronics from July 1-14).\n  - **Coupons**: Single-use, multi-use, stackable or exclusive. E.g., \"WELCOME10\"—new user 10% off, valid for first order only.\n  - **Loyalty Points (Mileage)**: Earned by purchases, can be redeemed on subsequent transactions. E.g., 5 points per $1 spent—customer earns 200 points on a $40 order, redeemable for $2 off next order.\n  - **Deposits**: Store credit from refunds or admin compensation. Can be partial or full, tracked separately from earned rewards.\n  - **Tiered Loyalty Systems**: Customer unlocks Silver, Gold, Platinum levels with increased purchase frequency/amounts, unlocking better rewards or privileges.\n  - **AI-Personalized Offers**: System recommends exclusive promotions based on browsing/buying patterns; e.g., customer interested in outdoor gear gets sent a private \"15% off backpacks\" coupon via in-site notification.\n\n---\n\n## User Scenarios\n| Actor      | Scenario                                                     | Step-by-Step Example |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Customer   | Browses shoes, gets AI-timed pop-up for 5% off coupon. Uses coupon at checkout, and earns 50 points (5 per $1 x $10). Later, sees a loyalty dashboard summarizing rewards and thus returns to shop more. |\n| Seller     | Launches a 'Buy 2 Get 1 Free' campaign via dashboard. Monitors real-time coupon usage analytics and adapts strategy if redemption rates are low (e.g., automatically toggling to free shipping offer). Also sets up product-bundle-exclusive coupons for loyal repeat customers. |\n| Admin      | Sets global holiday discounts, configures coupon stacking rules, adjusts monthly loyalty point multipliers, and receives anomaly alerts if coupon abuse is detected (e.g., by monitoring sudden spikes in redemptions from a single IP address). |\n\n**Sample Flow Diagram** (Customer Loyalty Point Use):\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n  A[Customer checkout] --> B{Eligible for points?}\n  B -- Yes --> C[Assign points]\n  C --> D[Show cumulative points]\n  B -- No --> E[Skip awarding]\n  D --> F[Offer redemption option]\n```\n\n---\n\n## System Requirements\n### Functional\n- Enable admins and sellers to create, edit, and schedule diverse promotions.\n- Auto-apply, personal, and trigger-based promotions (e.g., first purchase, birthday).\n- Allow customers to view rewards/coupon status (dashboard, my page).\n- Coupon validation at checkout (e.g., expiry, usage, stacking rules).\n- Points/deposit application/reversal after returns/refunds.\n- Analytics: Track issuance, usage, and ROI by customer/product/campaign.\n\n### Non-Functional\n- Response time under 2s for coupon validation and loyalty actions.\n- Horizontally scalable rewards ledger and analytics engines to handle high event loads during major sales.\n- Data integrity: transactional consistency between order, reward, and refund records.\n- Role-based access: Only sellers/admins can configure campaigns; customers only claim/use.\n- Compliance with regional promo regulations (e.g., expiry dates, clear display of benefits).\n\n---\n\n## System Flows\n### Example: Coupon Application Failure\nA customer enters a coupon at checkout that is expired. System immediately returns a clear error message, increments a \"bad attempt\" counter (for abuse detection), and suggests valid alternative coupons if available.\n\n### Example: Loyalty Point Redemption Edge Case\nIf customer attempts to redeem more points than their balance, system offers a \"use maximum allowed\" prompt, and logs the attempt for analytics.\n\n**Representative Transaction Flows**\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant C as Customer\n  participant S as System\n  C->>S: Enters coupon code at checkout\n  S-->>C: Validate code, apply if eligible\n  S-->>C: Error if invalid; alternatives if possible\n  C->>S: Selects loyalty points for next order\n  S-->>C: Deduct points, confirm, update dashboard\n```\n\n---\n\n## AI-Driven Promotion Examples\n- **Next Best Offer:** AI identifies a buyer with a high tendency to purchase luxury bags and sends a time-limited 20% coupon only valid for that category. Pattern-matching is based on item views, cart additions, and past successful promotions to similar users.\n- **Churn Prevention:** Detects at-risk users (e.g., 30 days inactivity) and delivers personalized \"Come Back\" bundles combining extra points with an exclusive coupon. Success rate tracked against a baseline group.\n- **A/B Testing:** AI experiments with different discount levels for similar user segments, dynamically promotes most effective offers.\n- **Data Flow Example:**\n  1. Event Stream: User clicks, purchases, coupon redemptions.\n  2. AI Model Input: Event data + user profile\n  3. AI Output: Real-time offer push (notification/email)\n\n---\n\n## KPIs and Analytics\n- **Metrics Calculated:**\n  - Coupon redemption rate (total used / total issued)\n  - Campaign ROI: (`(Additional sales from promotion - cost of discounts)/cost of discounts`)\n  - Repeat purchase rate before and after promotion\n  - Point liability tracking (outstanding/unredeemed)\n- **Analytic Methodologies:** \n  - Time series analysis of redemption and ROI\n  - User cohort segmentation (e.g., by location, age, last activity)\n  - Fraud detection models (flagging bulk or abnormal coupon uses)\n- **Sample Dashboard:**\n  - Line charts of coupon usage by day/category\n  - Heat maps of redemption by user segment\n  - Anomaly alerts on outlier activity\n\n---\n\n## User Roles & Management\nThe loyalty and promotion system depends on robust [User Roles & Management](./02_ai-mall_user-roles-and-management.md). Each feature, from personalization to campaign setup, requires role validation—only sellers and admins launch campaigns, while customers can only claim or redeem. Points, deposits and redemptions are associated with authenticated user profiles, enabling audit trails and fraud controls.\n\n## Product and Content Management\nPromotion applicability depends on [Product and Content Management](./03_ai-mall_product-and-content-management.md). Each promotion or coupon can be restricted to certain categories, brands, or SKUs, ensuring offers align with inventory and marketing goals. Returns, refunds, or bundled promotions require up-to-date catalog data to calculate accurate rewards.\n\n## Architecture & Extensibility\nThe promotion engine is architected to be extensible ([Architecture & Extensibility](./07_ai-mall_architecture-and-extensibility.md)). New reward types, rule engines, and AI models are plug-and-play via module interfaces, and analytics are exportable to external BI tools. Endpoints use secure, scalable APIs, enabling future integration of partner loyalty programs or 3rd-party AI personalization

AI Mall: Interaction and Personalization\n\n## 1. Interaction Modules\n\n### 1.1 Inquiries\nCustomers submit product or order-related questions, visible to sellers and optionally admins. Each inquiry stores status (open/answered), timestamps, related SKUs, and user metadata. Sellers receive notifications and respond via threaded comments. Edge case: bulk inquiries on promotions prompt automated FAQ suggestions. Example data flow: a customer asks a question (POST), seller replies (PATCH), customer receives a push/email per their preference center settings.\n\n### 1.2 Reviews and Ratings\nAfter fulfillment, customers leave reviews with multi-dimensional ratings (quality, value, delivery) and optional photos. Sellers may reply once per review; admins can hide flagged content. Edge case: reviews flagged for suspicious patterns (e.g., spam, repeated text) route to moderation. Developers must consider concurrency—editing reviews should lock the item. Sample payload: `{reviewId, userId, rating, body, images[], status, timestamps}`. Reviews update seller analytics and product reputation scores.\n\n### 1.3 Feedback Mechanism\nSystem-wide feedback (site suggestions, bugs) is submitted via an always-available form. Admins categorize (UX, technical, content), prioritize, and respond within SLA. Payload includes device info and URLs for reproducing bugs. Feedback affecting personal data triggers privacy escalation.\n\n### 1.4 Notifications and Preference Center\nUsers (customers/sellers) receive granular, channel-specific notifications—order status changes, inquiry replies, promos, moderation updates—via web, email, or app. The preference center enables toggling notification types and channels. Example flow: a customer disables promo emails but keeps order alerts. Permission scenario: only admins may bulk-edit seller notification settings. Edge case: notification delivery failures require user-facing logs.\n\n### 1.5 Favorites, Wish Lists, and Collections\nCustomers can favorite products, save to wish lists (product buckets, e.g., “Birthday Gifts”) or create custom collections. Collections include privacy toggles (public/private). API enforces user permission: only the account owner can modify wish lists. Sample data: `{collectionId, userId, label, items[], isPublic, created, modified}`. Edge case: merging wish lists after account sign-in from multiple devices.\n\n## 2. Personalization Features\n\n### 2.1 Personalized Recommendations\nAI-driven modules generate recommendations from behavior (browsing, cart, order, favorites), segment data (age, location), and context (season, trending). Example: system suggests items similar to recent purchases or upsells on checkout. Payload: `{userId, eventType, context, timestamp}`. Edge cases: new users (cold start) use popularity-based fallback logic; logged-out sessions use cookies/localStorage with opt-in.\n\n### 2.2 Dynamic Content Personalization\nLanding pages, emails, and push notifications adapt content blocks by user persona, interaction history, and real-time events. Example: homepage banners show “Back-to-School” deals for student-segmented users. Permission: sellers may apply rules to their own store, admins override global logic. Sample flow: user logs in > triggers segment lookup > receives dynamic banner assignment.\n\n### 2.3 Search and Navigation Customization\nSearch results and navigation menus reorder in real-time based on past preferences and behavior. The system weights products by purchase history, interactions, and promos shown/clicked. Edge case: a seller promotes a flash sale—affected products jump search ranking for targeted segments. Permissions: only sellers with marketing roles may influence their product sorting.\n\n## 3. Moderation & Compliance\n\n### 3.1 Moderation Flows\nCombines automated filters (toxic content, spam) with human moderation for user inquiries, reviews, and profiles. Typical actions: flag, approve, blacklist, or restore. Edge case: auto-flagged post gets instant temporary hide, pending moderator review within 24h. Moderators can escalate to admin for permanent actions.\n\n### 3.2 Audit Trails and Permission Boundaries\nAll moderation, personalization, and notification changes log to immutable audit trails. Example audit log format:\n\n```\n{\n  action: \"review_hide\",\n  actorRole: \"moderator\",\n  actorId: \"mod5983\",\n  targetId: \"review9123\",\n  timestamp: \"2025-07-24T03:19:02+09:00\",\n  reason: \"inappropriate language\"\n}\n```\n\nPermissions: customers can flag but not view moderation status; sellers manage their store’s flagged content; admins see and revert all moderation actions.\n\n## 4. Acceptance Criteria & Examples\n\n- **Submitting an Inquiry**: User sends inquiry > seller receives notification > seller reply visible within 5 minutes; system passes test if states advance accordingly.\n- **Review Moderation**: Admin hides a flagged review; audit log is created, and the review is no longer returned in product detail API.\n- **Preference Update**: User toggles off push promotions; system must not deliver these, which is verified by unit test with sample input `{userId: X, notifType: promo, enabled: false}`.\n- **Edge Cases**: Merging wish lists from two accounts retains all unique items; notification fails logs must link delivery errors to user records.\n- **Sample Test Case**: Submitting inappropriate review triggers auto-hide and alerts moderator. Input: review text with banned keywords. Output: review.hidden==true, audit log created.\n\n## Appendix\n\n### User Journeys and Flow Diagrams\n\n#### Sample Customer Journey\n1.

Each role has carefully structured permissions, access scopes, and security measures, ensuring compliance, operational efficiency, and an optimal user experience. This document describes each role in detail, maps their functional boundaries, and outlines user management best practices for the development team.\n\n---\n\n## 1. User Role Definitions\n\n| Role    | Description                                                                                                                                               |\n|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Customer| End-users who browse, purchase products, manage orders/carts, provide reviews/queries, and personalize their experience using AI-driven features.        |\n| Seller  | Merchants managing storefronts, product catalogues, inventory, order fulfillment, analytics, and communications, leveraging AI-based merchant tools.     |\n| Admin   | Platform operators with global access to manage users, content, analytics, compliance, approval workflows, and oversee all AI-powered system functions.  |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core Permissions Matrix\n\n| Capability                         | Customer | Seller | Admin |\n|-------------------------------------|:--------:|:------:|:-----:|\n| Registration/Sign In/Authentication |    ✓     |   ✓    |   ✓   |\n| Product Browsing/Search/AI Feed     |    ✓     |   ✗    |   ✓   |\n| Manage Own Cart/Order History       |    ✓     |   ✗    |   ✓   |\n| Manage Own Storefront/Products      |    ✗     |   ✓    |   ✓   |\n| Respond To Inquiries/Reviews        |    ✓     |   ✓    |   ✓   |\n| View Analytics                      |    ✗     |   ✓    |   ✓   |\n| System/User Management              |    ✗     |   ✗    |   ✓   |\n| Approvals & Compliance              |    ✗     |   ✗    |   ✓   |\n| Access AI System Configurations     |    ✗     |   ✗    |   ✓   |\n| Participate in Promotions           |    ✓     |   ✓    |   ✓   |\n| Write/Manage Reviews/Inquiries      |    ✓     |   ✓    |   ✓   |\n\n---\n\n## 3. User Lifecycle & Management Flows\n- **Registration & Authentication**: All roles support OAuth, email/password, and multi-factor authentication (configurable per client security policy). API-level role claims are enforced after every authentication event.\n- **Profile Management**: Users can view and edit personal or business profiles within bounds determined by their role. Sellers require verification before storefront activation; admins enforce policy compliance.\n- **User State Management**: All accounts maintain states (active, suspended, pending verification, deleted). Admins have override privileges.\n- **Role Transitions & Upgrades**: Transition flows (e.g., customer→seller) require approval, background verification, and possible re-authentication. Admin grants/revokes are tracked for audit compliance.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Security, Compliance & Data Access\n- **API Authentication & Role Enforcement**: JWTs/OAuth2 tokens encapsulate the `role` claim; API gates all requests based on the active role and permissions matrix.\n- **Sensitive Operations & Audit Trails**: All role elevation, user suspensions, and policy violations are logged and auditable. Access to sensitive endpoints (user data exports, admin tools) is restricted by role and context.\n- **Compliance**: Data protection and privacy are maintained as per regional/Jurisdictional requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Admin actions are auditable; user rights to access, modify, or delete personal data are surfaced via secure endpoints.\n\n---\n\nRefer to other system design files ([TOC](./00_ai-mall_toc.md)) for further architectural or technical expansion on user authentication or system extensibility.\n","03_ai-mall_product-and-content-management.md":"# Product and Content Management\n\n## Overview\n\nThis document details the design, requirements, and functional flow of the Product and Content Management system for AI Mall.

It covers how promotions, coupons, rewards (mileage/deposit), and advanced AI-driven personalization support business growth and retention. References to user roles, product/content management, and platform extensibility are summarized within relevant sections for developer clarity.\n\n---\n\n## Key Features\n- **Promotion Types**\n  - **Standard Discounts**: Percentage or fixed-amount, scheduled or triggered by events. E.g., Summer Sale (10% off all electronics from July 1-14).\n  - **Coupons**: Single-use, multi-use, stackable or exclusive. E.g., \"WELCOME10\"—new user 10% off, valid for first order only.\n  - **Loyalty Points (Mileage)**: Earned by purchases, can be redeemed on subsequent transactions. E.g., 5 points per $1 spent—customer earns 200 points on a $40 order, redeemable for $2 off next order.\n  - **Deposits**: Store credit from refunds or admin compensation. Can be partial or full, tracked separately from earned rewards.\n  - **Tiered Loyalty Systems**: Customer unlocks Silver, Gold, Platinum levels with increased purchase frequency/amounts, unlocking better rewards or privileges.\n  - **AI-Personalized Offers**: System recommends exclusive promotions based on browsing/buying patterns; e.g., customer interested in outdoor gear gets sent a private \"15% off backpacks\" coupon via in-site notification.\n\n---\n\n## User Scenarios\n| Actor      | Scenario                                                     | Step-by-Step Example |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Customer   | Browses shoes, gets AI-timed pop-up for 5% off coupon. Uses coupon at checkout, and earns 50 points (5 per $1 x $10). Later, sees a loyalty dashboard summarizing rewards and thus returns to shop more. |\n| Seller     | Launches a 'Buy 2 Get 1 Free' campaign via dashboard. Monitors real-time coupon usage analytics and adapts strategy if redemption rates are low (e.g., automatically toggling to free shipping offer). Also sets up product-bundle-exclusive coupons for loyal repeat customers. |\n| Admin      | Sets global holiday discounts, configures coupon stacking rules, adjusts monthly loyalty point multipliers, and receives anomaly alerts if coupon abuse is detected (e.g., by monitoring sudden spikes in redemptions from a single IP address). |\n\n**Sample Flow Diagram** (Customer Loyalty Point Use):\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n  A[Customer checkout] --> B{Eligible for points?}\n  B -- Yes --> C[Assign points]\n  C --> D[Show cumulative points]\n  B -- No --> E[Skip awarding]\n  D --> F[Offer redemption option]\n```\n\n---\n\n## System Requirements\n### Functional\n- Enable admins and sellers to create, edit, and schedule diverse promotions.\n- Auto-apply, personal, and trigger-based promotions (e.g., first purchase, birthday).\n- Allow customers to view rewards/coupon status (dashboard, my page).\n- Coupon validation at checkout (e.g., expiry, usage, stacking rules).\n- Points/deposit application/reversal after returns/refunds.\n- Analytics: Track issuance, usage, and ROI by customer/product/campaign.\n\n### Non-Functional\n- Response time under 2s for coupon validation and loyalty actions.\n- Horizontally scalable rewards ledger and analytics engines to handle high event loads during major sales.\n- Data integrity: transactional consistency between order, reward, and refund records.\n- Role-based access: Only sellers/admins can configure campaigns; customers only claim/use.\n- Compliance with regional promo regulations (e.g., expiry dates, clear display of benefits).\n\n---\n\n## System Flows\n### Example: Coupon Application Failure\nA customer enters a coupon at checkout that is expired. System immediately returns a clear error message, increments a \"bad attempt\" counter (for abuse detection), and suggests valid alternative coupons if available.\n\n### Example: Loyalty Point Redemption Edge Case\nIf customer attempts to redeem more points than their balance, system offers a \"use maximum allowed\" prompt, and logs the attempt for analytics.\n\n**Representative Transaction Flows**\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant C as Customer\n  participant S as System\n  C->>S: Enters coupon code at checkout\n  S-->>C: Validate code, apply if eligible\n  S-->>C: Error if invalid; alternatives if possible\n  C->>S: Selects loyalty points for next order\n  S-->>C: Deduct points, confirm, update dashboard\n```\n\n---\n\n## AI-Driven Promotion Examples\n- **Next Best Offer:** AI identifies a buyer with a high tendency to purchase luxury bags and sends a time-limited 20% coupon only valid for that category. Pattern-matching is based on item views, cart additions, and past successful promotions to similar users.\n- **Churn Prevention:** Detects at-risk users (e.g., 30 days inactivity) and delivers personalized \"Come Back\" bundles combining extra points with an exclusive coupon. Success rate tracked against a baseline group.\n- **A/B Testing:** AI experiments with different discount levels for similar user segments, dynamically promotes most effective offers.\n- **Data Flow Example:**\n  1. Event Stream: User clicks, purchases, coupon redemptions.\n  2. AI Model Input: Event data + user profile\n  3. AI Output: Real-time offer push (notification/email)\n\n---\n\n## KPIs and Analytics\n- **Metrics Calculated:**\n  - Coupon redemption rate (total used / total issued)\n  - Campaign ROI: (`(Additional sales from promotion - cost of discounts)/cost of discounts`)\n  - Repeat purchase rate before and after promotion\n  - Point liability tracking (outstanding/unredeemed)\n- **Analytic Methodologies:** \n  - Time series analysis of redemption and ROI\n  - User cohort segmentation (e.g., by location, age, last activity)\n  - Fraud detection models (flagging bulk or abnormal coupon uses)\n- **Sample Dashboard:**\n  - Line charts of coupon usage by day/category\n  - Heat maps of redemption by user segment\n  - Anomaly alerts on outlier activity\n\n---\n\n## User Roles & Management\nThe loyalty and promotion system depends on robust [User Roles & Management](./02_ai-mall_user-roles-and-management.md). Each feature, from personalization to campaign setup, requires role validation—only sellers and admins launch campaigns, while customers can only claim or redeem. Points, deposits and redemptions are associated with authenticated user profiles, enabling audit trails and fraud controls.\n\n## Product and Content Management\nPromotion applicability depends on [Product and Content Management](./03_ai-mall_product-and-content-management.md). Each promotion or coupon can be restricted to certain categories, brands, or SKUs, ensuring offers align with inventory and marketing goals. Returns, refunds, or bundled promotions require up-to-date catalog data to calculate accurate rewards.\n\n## Architecture & Extensibility\nThe promotion engine is architected to be extensible ([Architecture & Extensibility](./07_ai-mall_architecture-and-extensibility.md)). New reward types, rule engines, and AI models are plug-and-play via module interfaces, and analytics are exportable to external BI tools. Endpoints use secure, scalable APIs, enabling future integration of partner loyalty programs or 3rd-party AI personalization engines.\n\n---","06_ai-mall_interaction-and-personalization.md":"# AI Mall: Interaction and Personalization\n\n## 1. Interaction Modules\n\n### 1.1 Inquiries\nCustomers submit product or order-related questions, visible to sellers and optionally admins. Each inquiry stores status (open/answered), timestamps, related SKUs, and user metadata. Sellers receive notifications and respond via threaded comments. Edge case: bulk inquiries on promotions prompt automated FAQ suggestions. Example data flow: a customer asks a question (POST), seller replies (PATCH), customer receives a push/email per their preference center settings.\n\n### 1.2 Reviews and Ratings\nAfter fulfillment, customers leave reviews with multi-dimensional ratings (quality, value, delivery) and optional photos. Sellers may reply once per review; admins can hide flagged content. Edge case: reviews flagged for suspicious patterns (e.g., spam, repeated text) route to moderation. Developers must consider concurrency—editing reviews should lock the item. Sample payload: `{reviewId, userId, rating, body, images[], status, timestamps}`. Reviews update seller analytics and product reputation scores.\n\n### 1.3 Feedback Mechanism\nSystem-wide feedback (site suggestions, bugs) is submitted via an always-available form. Admins categorize (UX, technical, content), prioritize, and respond within SLA. Payload includes device info and URLs for reproducing bugs. Feedback affecting personal data triggers privacy escalation.\n\n### 1.4 Notifications and Preference Center\nUsers (customers/sellers) receive granular, channel-specific notifications—order status changes, inquiry replies, promos, moderation updates—via web, email, or app. The preference center enables toggling notification types and channels. Example flow: a customer disables promo emails but keeps order alerts. Permission scenario: only admins may bulk-edit seller notification settings. Edge case: notification delivery failures require user-facing logs.\n\n### 1.5 Favorites, Wish Lists, and Collections\nCustomers can favorite products, save to wish lists (product buckets, e.g., “Birthday Gifts”) or create custom collections. Collections include privacy toggles (public/private). API enforces user permission: only the account owner can modify wish lists. Sample data: `{collectionId, userId, label, items[], isPublic, created, modified}`. Edge case: merging wish lists after account sign-in from multiple devices.\n\n## 2. Personalization Features\n\n### 2.1 Personalized Recommendations\nAI-driven modules generate recommendations from behavior (browsing, cart, order, favorites), segment data (age, location), and context (season, trending). Example: system suggests items similar to recent purchases or upsells on checkout. Payload: `{userId, eventType, context, timestamp}`. Edge cases: new users (cold start) use popularity-based fallback logic; logged-out sessions use cookies/localStorage with opt-in.\n\n### 2.2 Dynamic Content Personalization\nLanding pages, emails, and push notifications adapt content blocks by user persona, interaction history, and real-time events. Example: homepage banners show “Back-to-School” deals for student-segmented users. Permission: sellers may apply rules to their own store, admins override global logic. Sample flow: user logs in > triggers segment lookup > receives dynamic banner assignment.\n\n### 2.3 Search and Navigation Customization\nSearch results and navigation menus reorder in real-time based on past preferences and behavior. The system weights products by purchase history, interactions, and promos shown/clicked. Edge case: a seller promotes a flash sale—affected products jump search ranking for targeted segments. Permissions: only sellers with marketing roles may influence their product sorting.\n\n## 3. Moderation & Compliance\n\n### 3.1 Moderation Flows\nCombines automated filters (toxic content, spam) with human moderation for user inquiries, reviews, and profiles. Typical actions: flag, approve, blacklist, or restore. Edge case: auto-flagged post gets instant temporary hide, pending moderator review within 24h. Moderators can escalate to admin for permanent actions.\n\n### 3.2 Audit Trails and Permission Boundaries\nAll moderation, personalization, and notification changes log to immutable audit trails. Example audit log format:\n\n```\n{\n  action: \"review_hide\",\n  actorRole: \"moderator\",\n  actorId: \"mod5983\",\n  targetId: \"review9123\",\n  timestamp: \"2025-07-24T03:19:02+09:00\",\n  reason: \"inappropriate language\"\n}\n```\n\nPermissions: customers can flag but not view moderation status; sellers manage their store’s flagged content; admins see and revert all moderation actions.\n\n## 4. Acceptance Criteria & Examples\n\n- **Submitting an Inquiry**: User sends inquiry > seller receives notification > seller reply visible within 5 minutes; system passes test if states advance accordingly.\n- **Review Moderation**: Admin hides a flagged review; audit log is created, and the review is no longer returned in product detail API.\n- **Preference Update**: User toggles off push promotions; system must not deliver these, which is verified by unit test with sample input `{userId: X, notifType: promo, enabled: false}`.\n- **Edge Cases**: Merging wish lists from two accounts retains all unique items; notification fails logs must link delivery errors to user records.\n- **Sample Test Case**: Submitting inappropriate review triggers auto-hide and alerts moderator. Input: review text with banned keywords. Output: review.hidden==true, audit log created.\n\n## Appendix\n\n### User Journeys and Flow Diagrams\n\n#### Sample Customer Journey\n1. Customer browses homepage\n2. Searches for “Wireless Earbuds”\n3. Adds favorite products to \"Birthday Gifts\" wish list\n4. Places order > receives order confirmation (email + web push)\n5.

Additionally, it covers file/attachment management, API gateway strategies, and the adoption of a microservices approach to ensure that the AI Mall evolves efficiently and reliably as business requirements or technologies change.\n\n## 1. Architectural Principles\n- **Modularity:** All business domains and features are defined as modules with standardized interfaces for easy maintenance and deployment.\n- **Channel & Section Abstraction:** Sales channels (web, mobile app, third-party platforms) and sections (specialty areas within channels) are designed to be added or reconfigured without impacting core systems.\n- **Category Flexibility:** Products and content are organized into dynamic, hierarchical categories, allowing expansion or reclassification as inventory evolves.\n- **Extensible APIs:** API endpoints are exposed via a gateway, ensuring easy onboarding of new channels, integrations, or partners.\n- **Data Consistency:** Shared data models and contract-driven development are applied across services to maintain consistency as the system expands.\n\n## 2. Extending Channels, Sections, and Categories\n- **Channels:** Each channel is configured with metadata (brand, domain, UI settings) and can be enabled/disabled dynamically. Merchants can request or launch new channels through an admin interface.\n- **Sections:** Sections segment channel experiences (e.g., lifestyle, electronics), each defined by configurable rules, permissions, and featured content.\n- **Category Management:** Categories use a tree structure, supporting drag-and-drop reordering, merging, and bulk actions from the admin UI. Category metadata is versioned for auditability.\n\n## 3. File and Attachment Handling\n- **File Service:** Attachments (product images, manuals, promotions) are managed through a file service supporting large file uploads, inline previews, and automatic media optimization.\n- **Access Control:** Roles (admin, seller, customer) are enforced for file visibility and manipulation. Expiring download links provide secure delivery for sensitive files.\n- **Storage Backends:** The architecture accommodates multiple storage providers—cloud or on-premises—using interchangeable adapters.\n\n## 4. API Gateway Integration\n- **Unified API Entry:** All traffic (internal/external) flows through a gateway, providing consistent authentication, throttling, and protocol translation.\n- **Routing Rules:** Channel and section-specific logic is abstracted at the gateway level, enabling fast onboarding or deprecation of endpoints.\n- **Developer Portal:** API documentation and sandbox environments support partners extending or integrating with AI Mall.\n\n## 5. Microservice Architecture\n- **Loose Coupling:** Business capabilities are isolated as services (orders, catalog, personalization, search) communicating through matured APIs or asynchronous events.\n- **Scalable Deployment:** Each microservice can be scaled, updated, or replaced independently to suit evolving workloads or technical advances.\n- **Service Registration:** Services declare their capabilities and dependencies consistently through a centralized registry.\n\n## 6. Modularity and Future-Proofing\n- **Plug-in Framework:** Optional modules (e.g., new payment gateways, analytics providers) can be registered with minimal friction.\n- **Configuration-Driven Behavior:** Behavioral changes (UI, business rules, feature toggles) are managed via configuration, reducing redeployment needs.\n- **Upgrade Path:** Robust documentation, versioning policies, and backward compatibility ensure safe upgrades and integration of future AI-driven features.\n\n---\n\n**See also:** [06_ai-mall_interaction-and-personalization.md](./06_ai-mall_interaction-and-personalization.md), [08_ai-mall_ai-and-advanced-analytics.md](./08_ai-mall_ai-and-advanced-analytics.md)\n","08_ai-mall_ai-and-advanced-analytics.md":"# AI and Advanced Analytics for AI Mall\n\n## 1.
