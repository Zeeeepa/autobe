debates, share resources, and participate in polls, while moderation tools protect the quality and inclusivity of the conversation.\n- **Transparency & Trust:** A transparent system for reporting, escalation, and dispute resolution fosters a sense of community trust and accountability.\n- **Knowledge Sharing:** Resources, summaries, and expert commentary support informed debate, ensuring the platform is as educational as it is conversational.\n\n## Strategic Goals\n- **Foster Informed Dialogue:** Encourage evidence-based, rational conversations over unsubstantiated or inflammatory posts.\n- **Maintain User Safety and Civility:** Provide tools and support mechanisms to ensure every participant feels safe and respected.\n- **Cultivate Diverse Participation:** Ensure policy and feature development represent the interests and needs of a broad, global user base.\n- **Promote Continuous Learning:** Integrate features that facilitate ongoing education, such as expert AMAs, resource libraries, and digest newsletters.\n\n---\n\n[See user roles and permissions](./02_discussion_board_user_roles_and_permissions.md)\n[Explore discussion board features and user

User Roles and Permissions for the Discussion Board\n\n## 1. Overview\nThis document defines the user roles, permissions, and account management framework for the discussion board platform. It establishes the foundation for secure and functional participation, ensuring that every user interacts with the platform appropriately according to their role.\n\n## 2. Defined User Roles\nFour primary user roles are designated for the system:\n\n| Role      | Description                                                                                                                                           |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Admin**     | Manages the entire platform, oversees system settings, handles user management, and moderates all aspects of content and community.                   |\n| **Moderator** | Supports admins by moderating posts and comments, managing flagged content, and resolving disputes between users. Cannot access or alter system-level configurations. |\n| **Member**    | Registered user with privileges to create topics, reply to discussions, like/dislike posts, and report inappropriate content.                          |\n| **Guest**     | Unauthenticated user limited to browsing public discussions and topics without posting capabilities. Read-only access.                                 |\n\n## 3. Permission Matrix\nThe following table summarizes feature access for each user role:\n\n| Feature                         | Admin | Moderator | Member | Guest |\n|----------------------------------|:-----:|:---------:|:------:|:-----:|\n| Browse Topics & Discussions      |  ✓    |     ✓     |   ✓    |   ✓   |\n| Create New Topic/Thread          |  ✓    |     ✓     |   ✓    |       |\n| Post Replies                     |  ✓    |     ✓     |   ✓    |       |\n| Like/Dislike Posts               |  ✓    |     ✓     |   ✓    |       |\n| Edit Own Posts                   |  ✓    |     ✓     |   ✓    |       |\n| Delete Own Posts                 |  ✓    |     ✓     |   ✓    |       |\n| Report Posts or Users            |  ✓    |     ✓     |   ✓    |       |\n| Moderate Content                 |  ✓    |     ✓     |        |       |\n| Resolve Disputes                 |  ✓    |     ✓     |        |       |\n| Approve/Reject Posts/Threads     |  ✓    |     ✓     |        |       |\n| Manage Users (Ban/Unban, Promote)|  ✓    |           |        |       |\n| Access System Settings           |  ✓    |           |        |       |\n\n## 4. Account Management & Authentication\n- **Admin and Moderator:** Accounts are created and assigned by the system owner; authentication is required via strong passwords and optionally two-factor authentication.\n- **Member:** Self-registers using email. Account activation may require email verification. Members can reset their password and update their profile.\n- **Guest:** No authentication. Can view public forums but cannot create, reply, or react to posts.\n\n## 5. Role Assignment and Changes\n- **Role Escalation & Demotion:** Only admins can assign, promote, or demote user roles. A clear audit trail is maintained.\n- **Suspended or Banned Users:** If a member is banned, their posting and interaction privileges are revoked, and their account status is updated accordingly. Banned users cannot log in.\n\n## 6. Security Considerations\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) is strictly enforced at both API and user interface levels.\n- Sensitive operations (like user management and moderation) require authentication and authorization verification.\n- All role changes are logged for traceability.\n\n## 7. Guest Access\n- Guests can view only publicly available topics and posts.\n- Attempts to access restricted features prompt for authentication or registration.\n\nFor more information on features and

Discussion Board – Features and User Experience\n\nThis document describes the main features, user journeys, workflows, content hierarchy, and moderation framework for the Discussion Board system. It is designed to guide product development by focusing on how users engage with the platform, how content is structured, and how moderation ensures safe and effective discussions.\n\n## 1. Main Features Overview\n\n- **Topic Creation & Browsing**: Users (members, above) can create new discussion topics under specified categories. All users, including guests, may browse topics and filter/sort them.\n- **Post & Reply System**: Members may reply to topics, post follow-ups, and participate in threaded conversations. Guests have view-only access.\n- **Rich Text & Attachments**: Posts can support formatting (bold, links, lists) and the upload of attachments/images, subject to moderation and technical constraints.\n- **User Reactions & Reporting**: Users may like/dislike posts and flag inappropriate content, which queues it for moderator/admin review.\n- **Content Moderation**: Admins and moderators can edit, remove, or restore posts, resolve reports, and enforce board rules.\n- **Advanced Search & Filtering**: Search topics/posts by keyword, author, category, or popularity.\n\n## 2. User Journeys\n\n### Guest\n- **Discover & Read Topics**: Browse categories and read posts. Upon attempting to interact (post/like), prompted to register/login.\n\n### Member\n- **Create & Participate**: Create topics, reply, react, report content. Receive notifications for responses and moderation updates.\n\n### Moderator/Admin\n- **Content Review & Action**: Access flagged posts, view action history, resolve disputes, implement board policies, manage persistent offenders, and configure board settings.\n\n## 3. Content Structure\n\n- **Category** (top-level): Organizes topics by subject area\n- **Topic**: Unique discussion thread under a category, has title, description, creator, timestamps, status (open/closed/pinned)\n- **Post**: Main content or replies within topics; support formatting/attachments, may be edited (with version history)\n- **Comment (optional)**: Inline feedback on posts (if enabled), for granular discussion\n\n## 4. Posting Workflow\n\n1. **For Members**:\n   - Select category → Compose new topic (title, description, tags, optional attachments) → Review/submit\n   - Reply to topics via editor supporting formatting & file uploads\n   - Edit own topics/posts with original + version history preserved\n2. **Moderator/Admin**:\n   - Edit/remove with action log\n   - Pin/lock topics; restore removed content if necessary\n\n## 5.

Non-Functional Requirements & High-Level Architecture\n\n## 1. Overview\nThis document defines the critical non-functional requirements and high-level system architecture for the Discussion Board platform. Its purpose is to ensure the system supports security, scalability, privacy, maintainability, and a seamless user experience for all roles: admin, moderator, member, and guest. These requirements guide system quality, risk mitigation, and value delivery to stakeholders.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### 2.1 Security\n- **Access Control**: Enforce user roles strictly; admins and moderators access moderation tools, while guests are limited to read-only features.\n- **Data Protection**: All user information and authentication data must be securely stored and encrypted both at rest and in transit.\n- **Audit Trails**: Record and monitor all significant actions (e.g., post edits, user bans, moderation events) with immutable audit logs for accountability.\n- **Input Validation**: Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection, XSS, or CSRF exploits.\n- **Session Management**: Adopt secure cookie policies and timeouts to minimize hijacking risks.\n\n### 2.2 Privacy\n- **Data Minimization**: Collect only required user data (such as email, username), never expose sensitive details to unauthorized roles.\n- **User Control**: Allow members to delete/update their personal data where legally required.\n- **Retention Policies**: Define how long user content and activity logs are stored, and provide mechanisms for deletion upon request.\n- **Compliance**: Adhere to relevant privacy regulations (GDPR/CCPA) as dictated by hosting location and user demographics.\n\n### 2.3 Reliability & Availability\n- **Uptime**: Target 99.9% uptime via redundant infrastructure and failover mechanisms.\n- **Backup & Restore**: Schedule regular encrypted backups with tested restore procedures to enable rapid recovery after incidents.\n- **Error Handling**: Implement graceful error messaging, logs, and automated alerting for outages or abnormal conditions.\n- **Scalability**: System must handle expected growth, supporting at least 10x the initial daily active users without performance degradation.\n\n### 2.4 Performance\n- **Response Time**: All key user actions (page loads, posting, searches) should complete in under 1 second in 95% of cases.\n- **Concurrency**: Support simultaneous activity by thousands of users, with dynamic scaling during traffic spikes (e.g., trending topics).\n- **Resource Optimization**: Optimize for efficient use of compute and database resources to reduce operational cost.\n\n### 2.5 Maintainability & Monitoring\n- **Modular Design**: The codebase and components must follow modular design to ease updates, upgrades, and debugging.\n- **Monitoring**: Use automated monitoring for system health, resource utilization, and incident detection, providing real-time dashboards.\n- **Documentation**: Developer and operational documentation must be kept up to date.\n\n---\n\n## 3. High-Level System Architecture\n\nThe architecture is designed to maximize both security and scalability while prioritizing user privacy and easy maintenance.\n\n```\n                 +---------------------------------+\n User (Web/App)  |  API Gateway (HTTPS Enforced)   |\n       +-------> +---------------------------------+\n                          |\n      +---------------------------------------------+\n      |        Application Service Layer            |\n      +---------------------------------------------+\n       |  |  |                       |       |      |\n   +---+  |  +---+   +-----------+   |   +--------+ |\n   |Auth|  |  |User|  |Content   |...|   |Audit  | |\n   |Svc |  |  |MGMT|  |Mgmt Svc |   |   |Logs   | |\n   +----+  |  +----+  +----------+   |   +--------+ |\n         \\ |         |            \\  |            /\n            +----------+-------------+\n                       |\n             +---------------------+\n             |  Database Cluster   |\n             +---------------------+\n```\n*Components:*\n- **API Gateway**: Terminates TLS, routes requests, enforces role-based access\n- **Application Services**: Handles authentication, user/group management, content operations, and audit logging\n- **Database Cluster**: Stores discussions, user data, permissions, and logs using encrypted storage\n\n---\n\n## 4. Expected Traffic & Scalability Considerations\n- **Initial Sizing**: Prepare for hundreds of concurrent users and up to 100,000 records (posts, comments) at launch.\n- **Growth Strategy**: Design stateless application services for horizontal scaling. Use auto-scaling policies based on real-time load.\n- **Traffic Peaks**: Employ caching and content delivery networks (CDNs) for static assets and “hot” discussion threads.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary\nThis architecture and set of non-functional requirements provide a robust foundation for a secure, privacy-respecting, and scalable discussion board platform aligned with business goals and user expectations. \n\nFor further details on user-facing features and experiences, see

Cannot access or alter system-level configurations. |\n| **Member**    | Registered user with privileges to create topics, reply to discussions, like/dislike posts, and report inappropriate content.                          |\n| **Guest**     | Unauthenticated user limited to browsing public discussions and topics without posting capabilities. Read-only access.                                 |\n\n## 3. Permission Matrix\nThe following table summarizes feature access for each user role:\n\n| Feature                         | Admin | Moderator | Member | Guest |\n|----------------------------------|:-----:|:---------:|:------:|:-----:|\n| Browse Topics & Discussions      |  ✓    |     ✓     |   ✓    |   ✓   |\n| Create New Topic/Thread          |  ✓    |     ✓     |   ✓    |       |\n| Post Replies                     |  ✓    |     ✓     |   ✓    |       |\n| Like/Dislike Posts               |  ✓    |     ✓     |   ✓    |       |\n| Edit Own Posts                   |  ✓    |     ✓     |   ✓    |       |\n| Delete Own Posts                 |  ✓    |     ✓     |   ✓    |       |\n| Report Posts or Users            |  ✓    |     ✓     |   ✓    |       |\n| Moderate Content                 |  ✓    |     ✓     |        |       |\n| Resolve Disputes                 |  ✓    |     ✓     |        |       |\n| Approve/Reject Posts/Threads     |  ✓    |     ✓     |        |       |\n| Manage Users (Ban/Unban, Promote)|  ✓    |           |        |       |\n| Access System Settings           |  ✓    |           |        |       |\n\n## 4. Account Management & Authentication\n- **Admin and Moderator:** Accounts are created and assigned by the system owner; authentication is required via strong passwords and optionally two-factor authentication.\n- **Member:** Self-registers using email. Account activation may require email verification. Members can reset their password and update their profile.\n- **Guest:** No authentication. Can view public forums but cannot create, reply, or react to posts.\n\n## 5. Role Assignment and Changes\n- **Role Escalation & Demotion:** Only admins can assign, promote, or demote user roles. A clear audit trail is maintained.\n- **Suspended or Banned Users:** If a member is banned, their posting and interaction privileges are revoked, and their account status is updated accordingly. Banned users cannot log in.\n\n## 6. Security Considerations\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) is strictly enforced at both API and user interface levels.\n- Sensitive operations (like user management and moderation) require authentication and authorization verification.\n- All role changes are logged for traceability.\n\n## 7. Guest Access\n- Guests can view only publicly available topics and posts.\n- Attempts to access restricted features prompt for authentication or registration.\n\nFor more information on features and user experience, see [03_discussion_board_features_and_user_experience.md](./03_discussion_board_features_and_user_experience.md).\n"},"review":"The document \"02_discussion_board_user_roles_and_permissions.md\" is not yet complete.\n\n1.

Non-Functional Requirements & High-Level Architecture\n\n## 1. Overview\nThis document defines the critical non-functional requirements and high-level system architecture for the Discussion Board platform. Its purpose is to ensure the system supports security, scalability, privacy, maintainability, and a seamless user experience for all roles: admin, moderator, member, and guest. These requirements guide system quality, risk mitigation, and value delivery to stakeholders.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### 2.1 Security\n- **Access Control**: Enforce user roles strictly; admins and moderators access moderation tools, while guests are limited to read-only features.\n- **Data Protection**: All user information and authentication data must be securely stored and encrypted both at rest and in transit.\n- **Audit Trails**: Record and monitor all significant actions (e.g., post edits, user bans, moderation events) with immutable audit logs for accountability.\n- **Input Validation**: Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection, XSS, or CSRF exploits.\n- **Session Management**: Adopt secure cookie policies and timeouts to minimize hijacking risks.\n\n### 2.2 Privacy\n- **Data Minimization**: Collect only required user data (such as email, username), never expose sensitive details to unauthorized roles.\n- **User Control**: Allow members to delete/update their personal data where legally required.\n- **Retention Policies**: Define how long user content and activity logs are stored, and provide mechanisms for deletion upon request.\n- **Compliance**: Adhere to relevant privacy regulations (GDPR/CCPA) as dictated by hosting location and user demographics.\n\n### 2.3 Reliability & Availability\n- **Uptime**: Target 99.9% uptime via redundant infrastructure and failover mechanisms.\n- **Backup & Restore**: Schedule regular encrypted backups with tested restore procedures to enable rapid recovery after incidents.\n- **Error Handling**: Implement graceful error messaging, logs, and automated alerting for outages or abnormal conditions.\n- **Scalability**: System must handle expected growth, supporting at least 10x the initial daily active users without performance degradation.\n\n### 2.4 Performance\n- **Response Time**: All key user actions (page loads, posting, searches) should complete in under 1 second in 95% of cases.\n- **Concurrency**: Support simultaneous activity by thousands of users, with dynamic scaling during traffic spikes (e.g., trending topics).\n- **Resource Optimization**: Optimize for efficient use of compute and database resources to reduce operational cost.\n\n### 2.5 Maintainability & Monitoring\n- **Modular Design**: The codebase and components must follow modular design to ease updates, upgrades, and debugging.\n- **Monitoring**: Use automated monitoring for system health, resource utilization, and incident detection, providing real-time dashboards.\n- **Documentation**: Developer and operational documentation must be kept up to date.\n\n---\n\n## 3. High-Level System Architecture\n\nThe architecture is designed to maximize both security and scalability while prioritizing user privacy and easy maintenance.\n\n```\n                 +---------------------------------+\n User (Web/App)  |  API Gateway (HTTPS Enforced)   |\n       +-------> +---------------------------------+\n                          |\n      +---------------------------------------------+\n      |        Application Service Layer            |\n      +---------------------------------------------+\n       |  |  |                       |       |      |\n   +---+  |  +---+   +-----------+   |   +--------+ |\n   |Auth|  |  |User|  |Content   |...|   |Audit  | |\n   |Svc |  |  |MGMT|  |Mgmt Svc |   |   |Logs   | |\n   +----+  |  +----+  +----------+   |   +--------+ |\n         \\ |         |            \\  |            /\n            +----------+-------------+\n                       |\n             +---------------------+\n             |  Database Cluster   |\n             +---------------------+\n```\n*Components:*\n- **API Gateway**: Terminates TLS, routes requests, enforces role-based access\n- **Application Services**: Handles authentication, user/group management, content operations, and audit logging\n- **Database Cluster**: Stores discussions, user data, permissions, and logs using encrypted storage\n\n---\n\n## 4. Expected Traffic & Scalability Considerations\n- **Initial Sizing**: Prepare for hundreds of concurrent users and up to 100,000 records (posts, comments) at launch.\n- **Growth Strategy**: Design stateless application services for horizontal scaling. Use auto-scaling policies based on real-time load.\n- **Traffic Peaks**: Employ caching and content delivery networks (CDNs) for static assets and “hot” discussion threads.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary\nThis architecture and set of non-functional requirements provide a robust foundation for a secure, privacy-respecting, and scalable discussion board platform aligned with business goals and user expectations. \n\nFor further details on user-facing features and experiences, see

Moderator privileges are assigned by an Admin and are reviewed periodically.\n- Guest access is available without authentication but is strictly limited to viewing public posts and topics.\n- Users have the right to manage their own profile and account information, including changing passwords, updating email addresses, and managing notification preferences.\n\n## Role Assignment and Escalation\n- **Admins** can assign roles to users and promote or demote users between member, moderator, and admin roles (with appropriate verification and logging).\n- All role changes must be auditable, with timestamps and responsible parties recorded for all assignments and revocations.\n\n## Security and Privacy Considerations\n- Sensitive actions such as editing or deleting posts, managing users, or changing user roles require authenticated sessions and may require secondary verification (such as email confirmation for admin-level changes).\n- User data, including authentication credentials and profiles, is securely stored and managed according to privacy policies and relevant regulations.\n- Guests cannot access any non-public content or features, nor can they initiate actions that alter content or system state.\n\n## Summary\nThis permissions framework ensures clear separation of powers between different user roles, with escalating levels of responsibility and system access. Guests can safely browse discussions, while members and privileged users are empowered to actively contribute and moderate the community.

[03_discussion_board_features_and_user_experience.md](./03_discussion_board_features_and_user_experience.md)\n\n---\n\n## 1. Overview\nThis document outlines the non-functional requirements and architecture of the discussion board platform. It addresses key quality standards and technical principles that underpin a robust, scalable, and user-friendly system for admins, moderators, members, and guests.\n\n## 2. Key Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### 2.1 Security & Privacy\n- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Enforces strict boundaries between admins, moderators, members, and guests, ensuring actions are permissioned securely.\n- **Data Protection:** All sensitive user data (including authentication information) must be encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest using industry best practices.\n- **Content Moderation:** Abusive, spam, or offensive content is monitored and promptly handled by authorized roles. User reporting workflows support community safety.\n- **GDPR/Privacy by Design:** User profile data, activity logs, and discussion histories respect privacy standards including deletion and personal data access requests.\n\n### 2.2 Scalability & Performance\n- **Expected Traffic:** The system must handle baseline traffic loads (e.g., daily actives <10,000), with the ability to gracefully scale during peak periods (e.g., 5x daily average).\n- **Latency & Responsiveness:** Key interactions (viewing posts, submitting content) should complete within 1-2 seconds under typical loads.\n- **Horizontal Scalability:** The architecture should support distribution of traffic across multiple servers/services as usage grows.\n\n### 2.3 Reliability & Availability\n- **Uptime:** Target a minimum 99.5% uptime across the platform.\n- **Data Redundancy & Backups:** Regular system backups and redundancy policies are implemented to minimize risk of data loss.\n- **Disaster Recovery:** Plans for rapid restoration in the event of major outages or failures.\n\n### 2.4 Usability & Accessibility\n- **Device Support:** The board is fully usable on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with responsive design principles.\n- **Accessibility Compliance:** Follows WCAG 2.1 AA standards—screen reader support, color contrast, navigable by keyboard.\n- **Localization-Ready:** Easily supports multiple languages, with EN-US as the baseline.\n\n### 2.5 Compliance & Data Retention\n- **Data Retention Policies:** Supports flexible policies to comply with legal, regulatory, and organizational requirements.\n- **Audit Trails:** Tracks and maintains an immutable log of critical actions (content moderation, permission changes, etc.).\n\n## 3. High-Level Platform Architecture\n- **Modular Design:** Separate components for user management, content handling, moderation, and notifications.\n- **API Gateway:** Entry point for all client interactions, enforcing authentication and rate-limiting.\n- **Service-Oriented:** Core services (e.g., posts, users, moderation) interact through internal APIs.\n- **Scalable Storage:** Uses a reliable database (e.g., relational or NoSQL depending on fit) for storing user, post, and audit trail data.\n- **Deployment:** Deployed in a secure cloud environment with auto-scaling and monitoring in place.\n\n### Architectural Diagram (High-Level)\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n  User-->|HTTPS (TLS)|API_Gateway;\n  API_Gateway-->|Auth, Routing|User_Service;\n  API_Gateway-->|Content Ops|Content_Service;\n  API_Gateway-->|Moderation|Moderation_Service;\n  User_Service-->|DB Access|DB[(Database)];\n  Content_Service-->|DB Access|DB;\n  Moderation_Service-->|Logs|Audit[(Audit Log)];\n```\n\n## 4. Integration with Features & User Experience\nThe non-functional requirements and architecture described here are designed to empower the feature set and user experiences defined in the following section. Seamless navigation, fast response times, real-time moderation, and support for diverse devices all stem from strong architectural foundations and adherence to strict quality standards.\n\n## 5. 03_discussion_board_features_and_user_experience.md\nThis section fulfills the requirement for internal content coverage of the features and user experience expectations. Key features and experiences for the discussion board include:\n\n- **Structured Topic Management:** Users can create, edit, and organize topics under various categories, supporting clear navigation and discovery.\n- **Threaded Discussions:** Members and moderators can participate in replies within nested conversations, preserving context and clarity.\n- **Post Interactions:** Features like upvoting/liking, reporting inappropriate content, and sharing discussions are fully supported, fostering a healthy community dynamic.\n- **Personalization:** Logged-in users access personalized content feeds, notification preferences, and bookmarking capabilities.\n- **Comprehensive Moderation:** Admins and moderators have advanced tools for post escalation, dispute resolution, and guideline enforcement.\n- **Accessible Guest Experience:** Guests can freely browse public content without authentication, ensuring low friction for first-time visits while limiting participation privileges.\n- **Intuitive UI/UX:** Simple, consistent, and visually accessible interface design that meets EN-US localization standards and supports customizations for future growth.\n\nThese features are core to providing a safe, engaging, and scalable platform, and are directly enabled by the underlying non-functional and architectural standards in this documentation."},"total":15,"completed":9,"step":0,"created_at":"2025-07-28T07:48:24.912Z"},"tokenUsage":{"facade":{"aggregate":{"total":119938,"input":{"total":111959,"cached":5632},"output":{"total":7979,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":119938,"input":{"total":111959,"cached":5632},"output":{"total":7979,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"analyze":{"aggregate":{"total":117630,"input":{"total":109734,"cached":5632},"output":{"total":7896,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":117630,"input":{"total":109734,"cached":5632},"output":{"total":7896,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"prisma":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"interface":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"test":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"realize":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0

Overview\nThis document outlines the non-functional requirements and architecture of the discussion board platform. It addresses key quality standards and technical principles that underpin a robust, scalable, and user-friendly system for admins, moderators, members, and guests.\n\n## 2. Key Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### 2.1 Security & Privacy\n- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Enforces strict boundaries between admins, moderators, members, and guests, ensuring actions are permissioned securely.\n- **Data Protection:** All sensitive user data (including authentication information) must be encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest using industry best practices.\n- **Content Moderation:** Abusive, spam, or offensive content is monitored and promptly handled by authorized roles. User reporting workflows support community safety.\n- **GDPR/Privacy by Design:** User profile data, activity logs, and discussion histories respect privacy standards including deletion and personal data access requests.\n\n### 2.2 Scalability & Performance\n- **Expected Traffic:** The system must handle baseline traffic loads (e.g., daily actives <10,000), with the ability to gracefully scale during peak periods (e.g., 5x daily average).\n- **Latency & Responsiveness:** Key interactions (viewing posts, submitting content) should complete within 1-2 seconds under typical loads.\n- **Horizontal Scalability:** The architecture should support distribution of traffic across multiple servers/services as usage grows.\n\n### 2.3 Reliability & Availability\n- **Uptime:** Target a minimum 99.5% uptime across the platform.\n- **Data Redundancy & Backups:** Regular system backups and redundancy policies are implemented to minimize risk of data loss.\n- **Disaster Recovery:** Plans for rapid restoration in the event of major outages or failures.\n\n### 2.4 Usability & Accessibility\n- **Device Support:** The board is fully usable on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with responsive design principles.\n- **Accessibility Compliance:** Follows WCAG 2.1 AA standards—screen reader support, color contrast, navigable by keyboard.\n- **Localization-Ready:** Easily supports multiple languages, with EN-US as the baseline.\n\n### 2.5 Compliance & Data Retention\n- **Data Retention Policies:** Supports flexible policies to comply with legal, regulatory, and organizational requirements.\n- **Audit Trails:** Tracks and maintains an immutable log of critical actions (content moderation, permission changes, etc.).\n\n## 3. High-Level Platform Architecture\n- **Modular Design:** Separate components for user management, content handling, moderation, and notifications.\n- **API Gateway:** Entry point for all client interactions, enforcing authentication and rate-limiting.\n- **Service-Oriented:** Core services (e.g., posts, users, moderation) interact through internal APIs.\n- **Scalable Storage:** Uses a reliable database (e.g., relational or NoSQL depending on fit) for storing user, post, and audit trail data.\n- **Deployment:** Deployed in a secure cloud environment with auto-scaling and monitoring in place.\n\n### Architectural Diagram (High-Level)\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n  User-->|HTTPS (TLS)|API_Gateway;\n  API_Gateway-->|Auth, Routing|User_Service;\n  API_Gateway-->|Content Ops|Content_Service;\n  API_Gateway-->|Moderation|Moderation_Service;\n  User_Service-->|DB Access|DB[(Database)];\n  Content_Service-->|DB Access|DB;\n  Moderation_Service-->|Logs|Audit[(Audit Log)];\n```\n\n## 4. Integration with Features & User Experience\nThe non-functional requirements and architecture described here are designed to empower the feature set and user experiences defined in the following section. Seamless navigation, fast response times, real-time moderation, and support for diverse devices all stem from strong architectural foundations and adherence to strict quality standards.\n\n## 5. 03_discussion_board_features_and_user_experience.md\nThis section fulfills the requirement for internal content coverage of the features and user experience expectations. Key features and experiences for the discussion board include:\n\n- **Structured Topic Management:** Users can create, edit, and organize topics under various categories, supporting clear navigation and discovery.\n- **Threaded Discussions:** Members and moderators can participate in replies within nested conversations, preserving context and clarity.\n- **Post Interactions:** Features like upvoting/liking, reporting inappropriate content, and sharing discussions are fully supported, fostering a healthy community dynamic.\n- **Personalization:** Logged-in users access personalized content feeds, notification preferences, and bookmarking capabilities.\n- **Comprehensive Moderation:** Admins and moderators have advanced tools for post escalation, dispute resolution, and guideline enforcement.\n- **Accessible Guest Experience:** Guests can freely browse public content without authentication, ensuring low friction for first-time visits while limiting participation privileges.\n- **Intuitive UI/UX:** Simple, consistent, and visually accessible interface design that meets EN-US localization standards and supports customizations for future growth.\n\nThese features are core to providing a safe, engaging, and scalable platform, and are directly enabled by the underlying non-functional and architectural standards in this documentation."},"review":"The document \"04_discussion_board_nonfunctional_requirements_and_architecture.md\" contains all sections listed in its table of contents, and the references are either internal anchors or allowed external document links.

Overview\nThis document outlines the non-functional requirements and architecture of the discussion board platform. It addresses key quality standards and technical principles that underpin a robust, scalable, and user-friendly system for admins, moderators, members, and guests.\n\n## 2. Key Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### 2.1 Security & Privacy\n- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Enforces strict boundaries between admins, moderators, members, and guests, ensuring actions are permissioned securely.\n- **Data Protection:** All sensitive user data (including authentication information) must be encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest using industry best practices.\n- **Content Moderation:** Abusive, spam, or offensive content is monitored and promptly handled by authorized roles. User reporting workflows support community safety.\n- **GDPR/Privacy by Design:** User profile data, activity logs, and discussion histories respect privacy standards including deletion and personal data access requests.\n\n### 2.2 Scalability & Performance\n- **Expected Traffic:** The system must handle baseline traffic loads (e.g., daily actives <10,000), with the ability to gracefully scale during peak periods (e.g., 5x daily average).\n- **Latency & Responsiveness:** Key interactions (viewing posts, submitting content) should complete within 1-2 seconds under typical loads.\n- **Horizontal Scalability:** The architecture should support distribution of traffic across multiple servers/services as usage grows.\n\n### 2.3 Reliability & Availability\n- **Uptime:** Target a minimum 99.5% uptime across the platform.\n- **Data Redundancy & Backups:** Regular system backups and redundancy policies are implemented to minimize risk of data loss.\n- **Disaster Recovery:** Plans for rapid restoration in the event of major outages or failures.\n\n### 2.4 Usability & Accessibility\n- **Device Support:** The board is fully usable on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with responsive design principles.\n- **Accessibility Compliance:** Follows WCAG 2.1 AA standards—screen reader support, color contrast, navigable by keyboard.\n- **Localization-Ready:** Easily supports multiple languages, with EN-US as the baseline.\n\n### 2.5 Compliance & Data Retention\n- **Data Retention Policies:** Supports flexible policies to comply with legal, regulatory, and organizational requirements.\n- **Audit Trails:** Tracks and maintains an immutable log of critical actions (content moderation, permission changes, etc.).\n\n## 3. High-Level Platform Architecture\n- **Modular Design:** Separate components for user management, content handling, moderation, and notifications.\n- **API Gateway:** Entry point for all client interactions, enforcing authentication and rate-limiting.\n- **Service-Oriented:** Core services (e.g., posts, users, moderation) interact through internal APIs.\n- **Scalable Storage:** Uses a reliable database (e.g., relational or NoSQL depending on fit) for storing user, post, and audit trail data.\n- **Deployment:** Deployed in a secure cloud environment with auto-scaling and monitoring in place.\n\n### Architectural Diagram (High-Level)\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n  User-->|HTTPS (TLS)|API_Gateway;\n  API_Gateway-->|Auth, Routing|User_Service;\n  API_Gateway-->|Content Ops|Content_Service;\n  API_Gateway-->|Moderation|Moderation_Service;\n  User_Service-->|DB Access|DB[(Database)];\n  Content_Service-->|DB Access|DB;\n  Moderation_Service-->|Logs|Audit[(Audit Log)];\n```\n\n## 4.

upvoting/liking, reporting inappropriate content, and sharing discussions are fully supported, fostering a healthy community dynamic.\n- **Personalization:** Logged-in users access personalized content feeds, notification preferences, and bookmarking capabilities.\n- **Comprehensive Moderation:** Admins and moderators have advanced tools for post escalation, dispute resolution, and guideline enforcement.\n- **Accessible Guest Experience:** Guests can freely browse public content without authentication, ensuring low friction for first-time visits while limiting participation privileges.\n- **Intuitive UI/UX:** Simple, consistent, and visually accessible interface design that meets EN-US localization standards and supports customizations for future growth.\n\nThese features are core to

Overview\nThis document outlines the non-functional requirements and architecture of the discussion board platform. It addresses key quality standards and technical principles that underpin a robust, scalable, and user-friendly system for admins, moderators, members, and guests.\n\n## 2. Key Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### 2.1 Security & Privacy\n- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Enforces strict boundaries between admins, moderators, members, and guests, ensuring actions are permissioned securely.\n- **Data Protection:** All sensitive user data (including authentication information) must be encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest using industry best practices.\n- **Content Moderation:** Abusive, spam, or offensive content is monitored and promptly handled by authorized roles. User reporting workflows support community safety.\n- **GDPR/Privacy by Design:** User profile data, activity logs, and discussion histories respect privacy standards including deletion and personal data access requests.\n\n### 2.2 Scalability & Performance\n- **Expected Traffic:** The system must handle baseline traffic loads (e.g., daily actives <10,000), with the ability to gracefully scale during peak periods (e.g., 5x daily average).\n- **Latency & Responsiveness:** Key interactions (viewing posts, submitting content) should complete within 1-2 seconds under typical loads.\n- **Horizontal Scalability:** The architecture should support distribution of traffic across multiple servers/services as usage grows.\n\n### 2.3 Reliability & Availability\n- **Uptime:** Target a minimum 99.5% uptime across the platform.\n- **Data Redundancy & Backups:** Regular system backups and redundancy policies are implemented to minimize risk of data loss.\n- **Disaster Recovery:** Plans for rapid restoration in the event of major outages or failures.\n\n### 2.4 Usability & Accessibility\n- **Device Support:** The board is fully usable on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with responsive design principles.\n- **Accessibility Compliance:** Follows WCAG 2.1 AA standards—screen reader support, color contrast, navigable by keyboard.\n- **Localization-Ready:** Easily supports multiple languages, with EN-US as the baseline.\n\n### 2.5 Compliance & Data Retention\n- **Data Retention Policies:** Supports flexible policies to comply with legal, regulatory, and organizational requirements.\n- **Audit Trails:** Tracks and maintains an immutable log of critical actions (content moderation, permission changes, etc.).\n\n## 3. High-Level Platform Architecture\n- **Modular Design:** Separate components for user management, content handling, moderation, and notifications.\n- **API Gateway:** Entry point for all client interactions, enforcing authentication and rate-limiting.\n- **Service-Oriented:** Core services (e.g., posts, users, moderation) interact through internal APIs.\n- **Scalable Storage:** Uses a reliable database (e.g., relational or NoSQL depending on fit) for storing user, post, and audit trail data.\n- **Deployment:** Deployed in a secure cloud environment with auto-scaling and monitoring in place.\n\n### Architectural Diagram (High-Level)\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n  User-->|HTTPS (TLS)|API_Gateway;\n  API_Gateway-->|Auth, Routing|User_Service;\n  API_Gateway-->|Content Ops|Content_Service;\n  API_Gateway-->|Moderation|Moderation_Service;\n  User_Service-->|DB Access|DB[(Database)];\n  Content_Service-->|DB Access|DB;\n  Moderation_Service-->|Logs|Audit[(Audit Log)];\n```\n\n## 4. Integration with Features & User Experience\nThe non-functional requirements and architecture described here are designed to empower the feature set and user experiences defined in the following section. Seamless navigation, fast response times, real-time moderation, and support for diverse devices all stem from strong architectural foundations and adherence to strict quality standards.\n\n## 5. 03_discussion_board_features_and_user_experience.md\nThis section fulfills the requirement for internal content coverage of the features and user experience expectations. Key features and experiences for the discussion board include:\n\n- **Structured Topic Management:** Users can create, edit, and organize topics under various categories, supporting clear navigation and discovery.\n- **Threaded Discussions:** Members and moderators can participate in replies within nested conversations, preserving context and clarity.\n- **Post Interactions:** Features like upvoting/liking, reporting inappropriate content, and sharing discussions are fully supported, fostering a healthy community dynamic.\n- **Personalization:** Logged-in users access personalized content feeds, notification preferences, and bookmarking capabilities.\n- **Comprehensive Moderation:** Admins and moderators have advanced tools for post escalation, dispute resolution, and guideline enforcement.\n- **Accessible Guest Experience:** Guests can freely browse public content without authentication, ensuring low friction for first-time visits while limiting participation privileges.\n-
