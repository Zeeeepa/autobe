User Roles and Journeys in the Discussion Board\n\n## Overview\nThis document outlines the user roles, their permissions, registration/authentication processes, and diverse user journeys within the Discussion Board platform. Adhering to these profiles and flows ensures a cohesive experience, clarity in feature design, and efficient platform management by role.\n\n---\n\n## 1. User Roles & Permissions\n\n| Role       | Description                                                                                      | Key Permissions                                                    |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Admin**      | Full platform authority, oversees content, users, rules, and moderation                   | Manage users, configure settings, remove/restore content, audit    |\n| **Moderator**  | Enforces community guidelines and content quality                                           | Remove posts/comments, handle reports, support admins              |\n| **Member**     | Registered users; primary content creators and interactors                                 | Create/edit/delete own posts/comments, react, report content       |\n| **Guest**      | Unauthenticated visitors; limited to viewing public content                                | View public content only                                           |\n\n\n---\n\n## 2. Registration, Authentication, & Role Assignment\n\n### 2.1 Guest → Member Flow\n1. Guest visits the discussion board, browses topics and posts.\n2. On attempting to post, comment, or react, the guest is prompted to register.\n3. Registration collects essential information (username, password, email, agreement to terms).\n4. Upon successful registration and (optional) email verification, the user is authenticated as a member.\n\n### 2.2 Role Elevation (Member → Moderator → Admin)\n- Promotion or demotion is performed by an admin via the platform’s management interface.\n- Moderators may be promoted from members based on community standing; admin roles are tightly controlled.\n\n### 2.3 Authentication\n- Users authenticate via login (credentials: username/email + password or federated SSO if enabled).\n- Session management follows industry standards (token/cookie-based auth).\n\n---\n\n## 3. User Journeys\n\n### 3.1 Admin Journey\n- Reviews platform analytics and moderation queue.\n- Appoints moderators, adjusts permissions, or handles escalated incidents.\n- Updates content policy, removes abusive users, and oversees technical configurations.\n\n### 3.2 Moderator Journey\n- Monitors flagged content, reviews reports from members.\n- Uses moderation tools to remove or edit posts/comments violating policies.\n- Communicates resolution outcomes to users and escalates complex cases to admins.\n\n### 3.3 Member Journey\n- Registers and customizes profile.\n- Participates by posting, commenting, or reacting to content.\n- Reports inappropriate material and engages in votes or discussions.\n\n### 3.4 Guest Journey\n- Explores categories and reads public discussions.\n- Sees clear calls-to-action encouraging registration to join and contribute.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Permissions Matrix (by Role and Action)\n\n| Action                  | Admin | Moderator | Member | Guest |\n|-------------------------|:-----:|:---------:|:------:|:-----:|\n| View Topics/Posts       |  ✔   |     ✔     |   ✔    |   ✔   |\n| Create Posts/Comments   |  ✔   |     ✔     |   ✔    |   ✖   |\n| Edit Own Posts/Comments |  ✔   |     ✔     |   ✔    |   ✖   |\n| Remove Any Content      |  ✔   |     ✔     |   ✖    |   ✖   |\n| Moderate Reports        |  ✔   |     ✔     |   ✖    |   ✖   |\n| Manage Users/Roles      |  ✔   |     ✖     |   ✖    |   ✖   |\n| Report Content          |  ✔   |     ✔     |   ✔    |   ✖   |\n| Access Admin Tools      |  ✔   |     ✖     |   ✖    |   ✖   |\n| Like/Dislike Content    |  ✔   |     ✔     |   ✔    |   ✖   |\n\n---\n\n## 5. User Role Transitions Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Guest-->|Registers|Member\n  Member-->|Admin Promotes|Moderator\n  Moderator-->|Admin Promotes|Admin\n  Admin-->|Demotes|Moderator\n  Moderator-->|Demotes|Member\n  Member-->|Deactivates|Guest\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summary\n- The platform’s user experience is driven by a clearly articulated role structure, secure authentication, and defined permissions for action.\n- Journeys and permissions matrices enable scoping, onboarding, and content safety measures for each role while supporting platform growth and healthy community interaction.\n\n[Return to Table of
