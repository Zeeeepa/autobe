Introduction to the Political/Economic Discussion Board\n\n## Overview\nThe Political/Economic Discussion Board is designed as a modern digital forum aimed at fostering meaningful, informed, and civil discourse around political and economic topics. In an era characterized by rapid information exchange and complex global issues, the board serves as a dedicated space where users ranging from casual observers to experts can engage with diverse perspectives, share knowledge, and participate in constructive conversations.\n\n## Vision\nOur vision is to build a trusted, high-quality online community where every voice is respected and fact-based debate thrives. By providing a responsive, inclusive, and safe environment, the discussion board aspires to elevate the standard of political and economic dialogue, reduce misinformation, and empower users to make more informed decisions.\n\n## Project Objectives\n- **Promote Civic Engagement:** Encourage active participation in discussions that impact society, policy, and the economy.\n- **Facilitate Quality Debate:** Support nuanced, evidence-based debate through features such as voting, moderation, and categorization.\n- **Foster Inclusivity:** Ensure a welcoming atmosphere for users with varied backgrounds, ideologies, and expertise, enforced through clear community guidelines and multi-tiered moderation.\n- **Deliver Educational Value:** Create a platform where learners, professionals, and the general public can access curated, easy-to-navigate discussions and resources.\n- **Support Policy Discourse:** Provide a venue for analyzing legislation, news events, and economic trends, enabling collaborative problem-solving and informed policy critique.\n\n## Target Audience\n- **General Public:** Individuals seeking reliable, accessible discussion on current affairs without the noise often found on less-moderated platforms.\n- **Students and Academics:** Users conducting research or participating in educational projects, benefiting from organized and referenced content.\n- **Professionals and Experts:** Economists, analysts, political commentators, and policy stakeholders sharing insights and engaging in high-level debate.\n- **Civil Society Organizations:** Non-profits and advocacy groups aiming to drive awareness and dialogue around political or economic issues.\n\n## Key Value Proposition\n- **Multi-Tiered Access:** Secure, role-based permissions tailored for guests (read-only), members (interaction), moderators (content oversight), and administrators (full control).\n- **Robust Moderation Tools:** Automated and manual mechanisms for maintaining civility and preventing misinformation.\n- **Easy Discovery and Archiving:** Powerful search, categorization, and archiving features to ensure content is both discoverable and preserved.\n- **Community-Driven Recognition:** Reputation, voting, and reward systems that surface quality content and incentivize meaningful contributions.\n\nBy implementing these principles, the Political/Economic Discussion Board positions itself as a leading forum for high-value digital discourse in the political and economic domains."},"total":15,"completed":2,"step":0,"created_at":"2025-07-22T14:15:09.118Z"},"tokenUsage":{"facade":{"aggregate":{"total":20983,"input":{"total":19376,"cached":1792},"output":{"total":1607,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":20983,"input":{"total":19376,"cached":1792},"output":{"total":1607,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"analyze":{"aggregate":{"total":18706,"input":{"total":17151,"cached":1792},"output":{"total":1555,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":18706,"input":{"total":17151,"cached":1792},"output":{"total":1555,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"prisma":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"interface":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"test":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"realize":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":

In an era characterized by rapid information exchange and complex global issues, the board serves as a dedicated space where users ranging from casual observers to experts can engage with diverse perspectives, share knowledge, and participate in constructive conversations.\n\n## Vision\nOur vision is to build a trusted, high-quality online community where every voice is respected and fact-based debate thrives. By providing a responsive, inclusive, and safe environment, the discussion board aspires to elevate the standard of political and economic dialogue, reduce misinformation, and empower users to make more informed decisions.\n\n## Project Objectives\n- **Promote Civic Engagement:** Encourage active participation in discussions that impact society, policy, and the economy.\n- **Facilitate Quality Debate:** Support nuanced, evidence-based debate through features such as voting, moderation, and categorization.\n- **Foster Inclusivity:** Ensure a welcoming atmosphere for users with varied backgrounds, ideologies, and expertise, enforced through clear community guidelines and multi-tiered moderation.\n- **Deliver Educational Value:** Create a platform where learners, professionals, and the general public can access curated, easy-to-navigate discussions and resources.\n- **Support Policy Discourse:** Provide a venue for analyzing legislation, news events, and economic trends, enabling collaborative problem-solving and informed policy critique.\n\n## Target Audience\n- **General Public:** Individuals seeking reliable, accessible discussion on current affairs without the noise often found on less-moderated platforms.\n- **Students and Academics:** Users conducting research or participating in educational projects, benefiting from organized and referenced content.\n- **Professionals and Experts:** Economists, analysts, political commentators, and policy stakeholders sharing insights and engaging in high-level debate.\n- **Civil Society Organizations:** Non-profits and advocacy groups aiming to drive awareness and dialogue around political or economic issues.\n\n## Key Value Proposition\n- **Multi-Tiered Access:** Secure, role-based permissions tailored for guests (read-only), members (interaction), moderators (content oversight), and administrators (full control).\n- **Robust Moderation Tools:** Automated and manual mechanisms for maintaining civility and preventing misinformation.\n- **Easy Discovery and Archiving:** Powerful search, categorization, and archiving features to ensure content is both discoverable and preserved.\n- **Community-Driven Recognition:** Reputation, voting, and reward systems that surface quality content and incentivize meaningful contributions.\n\nBy implementing these principles, the Political/Economic Discussion Board positions itself as a leading forum for high-value digital discourse in the political and economic domains."},"review":"The file `01_discussion_board_introduction.md` contains sufficient detail and structure for an introduction page.

Role Responsibilities\n- **Guest**: Access to general board content only; cannot participate in discussions or interact.\n- **Member**: Drives discussions, contributes content, manages own posts, and reports issues.\n- **Moderator**: Reviews flagged content, edits or removes inappropriate posts, and provides community support.\n- **Administrator**: Oversees all system operations, manages users and roles, configures policies, and ensures uptime/security.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Authentication and Authorization Logic\n- **Guests**: Sessions are tracked anonymously; no authentication needed.\n- **Members**: Must complete registration and verification to receive authenticated sessions; all interactive actions require authentication.\n- **Moderators & Administrators**: Roles assigned by administrator, requiring additional verification and logged access for transparency. All privileged actions are recorded.\n\nAll roles are evaluated at each endpoint/action via API middleware to ensure consistent permissions enforcement.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Role-Based User Flows\n\n### Guest\n1. Accesses site without logging in.\n2. Browses available public threads and topics.\n3. Tries to interact (e.g., comment) — redirected to sign-up/login page.\n\n### Member\n1. Registers and logs in to the system.\n2. Creates a new discussion or participates in existing topics.\n3. Edits or deletes their own contributions.\n4. Reports inappropriate content for review.\n\n### Moderator\n1. Signs in and receives moderation panel access.\n2. Reviews reports, edits or removes problematic content.\n3. Communicates with members as needed.\n\n### Administrator\n1. Logs in with admin credentials.\n2. Configures system settings, assigns moderator roles, audits activity.\n3. Manages user accounts, security, and site-wide policies.\n\n---\n\n## 6.
