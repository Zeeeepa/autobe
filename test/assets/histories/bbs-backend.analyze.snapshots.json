Unlike general-purpose boards, this forum targets users such as policy enthusiasts, academics, students, professionals, and members of the public who seek constructive debate on complex national and international issues. Its moderation philosophy is rooted in balancing open dialogue with community welfare: moderators are empowered not just to remove harmful or off-topic posts, but to actively foster a climate where evidence-based arguments, respectful disagreement, and diversity of perspectives are valued. The platform will incorporate rigorous content flagging, transparent moderation logs, clear community guidelines, and feedback loops to ensure optimum discussion quality. \"High-quality discussion\" is defined not only by civility, but by the prevalence of well-reasoned, well-sourced contributions and the minimization of personal attacks, misinformation, or echo chambers. \n\n## Vision\nOur vision is to become the premier digital space for informed and meaningful debate in political and economic domains. We aim to address the challenges of polarization, the spread of misinformation, trolling, and the often hostile environments found on competing platforms. The Discussion Board's core values—integrity, transparency, and inclusiveness—are demonstrated through features such as public moderation logs, statistical reporting on flagged content, inclusive onboarding for new voices, and technical measures against bots and shills. Concrete targets include: a 90% user satisfaction rate regarding fairness of moderation; a <5% prevalence of reported misinformation on trending threads (as verified by fact-checking); and measurable diversity in users' backgrounds and viewpoints. The platform strives for a reputation where users trust the reliability, openness, and fairness of discourse, supported by systems that reward constructive engagement and the elevation of underrepresented perspectives.\n\n## Business Goals\n- **Foster a Vibrant Community**: Achieve sustained daily participation of 5,000+ engaged members within 12 months. Example initiatives include topic-of-the-week contests and expert AMAs. Metrics: DAU/MAU, new post volume, and retention rates.\n- **Ensure High-Quality Dialogue**: Implement incentive systems for upvoted, well-researched posts, such as recognition badges and access to premium features. Projected outcome: 70% of threads surpass a discussion quality threshold (measured via peer review and moderator scoring).\n- **Monetize Responsibly**: Offer optional paid memberships granting access to exclusive reports, ad-free browsing, and advanced analytics, aiming for a 3%+ conversion rate by end of year one. Metrics: MRR, user upgrade rate, churn analysis.\n- **Safeguard Security & Compliance**: Establish GDPR-compliant data policies with regular audits and user-friendly consent tools. Track: zero reportable data incidents per year, positive user security perception surveys.\n\n## Core Objectives\n- **Promote Constructive Dialogue**: Encourage practices such as citing sources, using structured arguments, and refraining from personal attacks. Employ behavioral guidelines and visible incentives (e.g., badges for civil discourse) with AI-assisted moderation support to recognize and highlight exemplary contributions.\n- **Maintain Platform Integrity & Trust**: Instill robust mechanisms against manipulation (e.g., coordinated inauthentic behavior, astroturfing), regular disclosure of moderation actions, and a user reputation system. Objective: cultivate trust through visible accountability and open feedback.\n- **Prioritize Robust Security & Data Governance**: Use state-of-the-art encryption, strict access control, and secure audit trails for all sensitive operations. Ensure users can manage their privacy preferences easily and transparently. Regularly review systems for vulnerabilities, maintaining compliance with all applicable legal standards.\n\n## Discussion Board User Roles and Permissions\nThis section will provide a detailed breakdown of all user types and their associated permissions, mapped directly to system authentication and authorization protocols. It will define what regular members, moderators, and admins can do, supported by scenarios such as posting, editing, moderating, and accessing configuration settings. This enables clarity for developers implementing role-based access controls and supports transparency for all users regarding platform governance.","02_DiscussionBoard_User_Roles_and_Permissions.md":"# 02.

Unlike general-purpose boards, this forum targets users such as policy enthusiasts, academics, students, professionals, and members of the public who seek constructive debate on complex national and international issues. Its moderation philosophy is rooted in balancing open dialogue with community welfare: moderators are empowered not just to remove harmful or off-topic posts, but to actively foster a climate where evidence-based arguments, respectful disagreement, and diversity of perspectives are valued. The platform will incorporate rigorous content flagging, transparent moderation logs, clear community guidelines, and feedback loops to ensure optimum discussion quality. \"High-quality discussion\" is defined not only by civility, but by the prevalence of well-reasoned, well-sourced contributions and the minimization of personal attacks, misinformation, or echo chambers. \n\n## Vision\nOur vision is to become the premier digital space for informed and meaningful debate in political and economic domains. We aim to address the challenges of polarization, the spread of misinformation, trolling, and the often hostile environments found on competing platforms. The Discussion Board's core values—integrity, transparency, and inclusiveness—are demonstrated through features such as public moderation logs, statistical reporting on flagged content, inclusive onboarding for new voices, and technical measures against bots and shills. Concrete targets include: a 90% user satisfaction rate regarding fairness of moderation; a <5% prevalence of reported misinformation on trending threads (as verified by fact-checking); and measurable diversity in users' backgrounds and viewpoints. The platform strives for a reputation where users trust the reliability, openness, and fairness of discourse, supported by systems that reward constructive engagement and the elevation of underrepresented perspectives.\n\n## Business Goals\n- **Foster a Vibrant Community**: Achieve sustained daily participation of 5,000+ engaged members within 12 months. Example initiatives include topic-of-the-week contests and expert AMAs. Metrics: DAU/MAU, new post volume, and retention rates.\n- **Ensure High-Quality Dialogue**: Implement incentive systems for upvoted, well-researched posts, such as recognition badges and access to premium features. Projected outcome: 70% of threads surpass a discussion quality threshold (measured via peer review and moderator scoring).\n- **Monetize Responsibly**: Offer optional paid memberships granting access to exclusive reports, ad-free browsing, and advanced analytics, aiming for a 3%+ conversion rate by end of year one. Metrics: MRR, user upgrade rate, churn analysis.\n- **Safeguard Security & Compliance**: Establish GDPR-compliant data policies with regular audits and user-friendly consent tools. Track: zero reportable data incidents per year, positive user security perception surveys.\n\n## Core Objectives\n- **Promote Constructive Dialogue**: Encourage practices such as citing sources, using structured arguments, and refraining from personal attacks. Employ behavioral guidelines and visible incentives (e.g., badges for civil discourse) with AI-assisted moderation support to recognize and highlight exemplary contributions.\n- **Maintain Platform Integrity & Trust**: Instill robust mechanisms against manipulation (e.g., coordinated inauthentic behavior, astroturfing), regular disclosure of moderation actions, and a user reputation system. Objective: cultivate trust through visible accountability and open feedback.\n- **Prioritize Robust Security & Data Governance**: Use state-of-the-art encryption, strict access control, and secure audit trails for all sensitive operations. Ensure users can manage their privacy preferences easily and transparently. Regularly review systems for vulnerabilities, maintaining compliance with all applicable legal standards.\n\n## Discussion Board User Roles and Permissions\nThis section will provide a detailed breakdown of all user types and their associated permissions, mapped directly to system authentication and authorization protocols. It will define what regular members, moderators, and admins can do, supported by scenarios such as posting, editing, moderating, and accessing configuration settings. This enables clarity for developers implementing role-based access controls and supports transparency for all users regarding platform governance.","02_DiscussionBoard_User_Roles_and_Permissions.md":"# 02.

Discussion Board Project Overview and Objectives\n\n## Overview\nThe Discussion Board is designed as a dedicated online platform for in-depth political and economic discussion, setting itself apart from conventional forums through intentional community design, moderation excellence, and a commitment to discussion quality. Unlike general-purpose boards, this forum targets users such as policy enthusiasts, academics, students, professionals, and members of the public who seek constructive debate on complex national and international issues. Its moderation philosophy is rooted in balancing open dialogue with community welfare: moderators are empowered not just to remove harmful or off-topic posts, but to actively foster a climate where evidence-based arguments, respectful disagreement, and diversity of perspectives are valued. The platform will incorporate rigorous content flagging, transparent moderation logs, clear community guidelines, and feedback loops to ensure optimum discussion quality. \"High-quality discussion\" is defined not only by civility, but by the prevalence of well-reasoned, well-sourced contributions and the minimization of personal attacks, misinformation, or echo chambers. \n\n## Vision\nOur vision is to become the premier digital space for informed and meaningful debate in political and economic domains. We aim to address the challenges of polarization, the spread of misinformation, trolling, and the often hostile environments found on competing platforms. The Discussion Board's core values—integrity, transparency, and inclusiveness—are demonstrated through features such as public moderation logs, statistical reporting on flagged content, inclusive onboarding for new voices, and technical measures against bots and shills. Concrete targets include: a 90% user satisfaction rate regarding fairness of moderation; a <5% prevalence of reported misinformation on trending threads (as verified by fact-checking); and measurable diversity in users' backgrounds and viewpoints. The platform strives for a reputation where users trust the reliability, openness, and fairness of discourse, supported by systems that reward constructive engagement and the elevation of underrepresented perspectives.\n\n## Business Goals\n- **Foster a Vibrant Community**: Achieve sustained daily participation of 5,000+ engaged members within 12 months. Example initiatives include topic-of-the-week contests and expert AMAs. Metrics: DAU/MAU, new post volume, and retention rates.\n- **Ensure High-Quality Dialogue**: Implement incentive systems for upvoted, well-researched posts, such as recognition badges and access to premium features. Projected outcome: 70% of threads surpass a discussion quality threshold (measured via peer review and moderator scoring).\n- **Monetize Responsibly**: Offer optional paid memberships granting access to exclusive reports, ad-free browsing, and advanced analytics, aiming for a 3%+ conversion rate by end of year one. Metrics: MRR, user upgrade rate, churn analysis.\n- **Safeguard Security & Compliance**: Establish GDPR-compliant data policies with regular audits and user-friendly consent tools. Track: zero reportable data incidents per year, positive user security perception surveys.\n\n## Core Objectives\n- **Promote Constructive Dialogue**: Encourage practices such as citing sources, using structured arguments, and refraining from personal attacks. Employ behavioral guidelines and visible incentives (e.g., badges for civil discourse) with AI-assisted moderation support to recognize and highlight exemplary contributions.\n- **Maintain Platform Integrity & Trust**: Instill robust mechanisms against manipulation (e.g., coordinated inauthentic behavior, astroturfing), regular disclosure of moderation actions, and a user reputation system. Objective: cultivate trust through visible accountability and open feedback.\n- **Prioritize Robust Security & Data Governance**: Use state-of-the-art encryption, strict access control, and secure audit trails for all sensitive operations. Ensure users can manage their privacy preferences easily and transparently. Regularly review systems for vulnerabilities, maintaining compliance with all applicable legal standards.\n\n## Discussion Board User Roles and Permissions\nThis section will provide a detailed breakdown of all user types and their associated permissions, mapped directly to system authentication and authorization protocols. It will define what regular members, moderators, and admins can do, supported by scenarios such as posting, editing, moderating, and accessing configuration settings. This enables clarity for developers implementing role-based access controls and supports transparency for all users regarding platform governance."},"step":0,"created_at":"2025-07-22T08:12:08.067Z"},"tokenUsage":{"facade":{"aggregate":{"total":33012,"input":{"total":31390,"cached":0},"output":{"total":1622,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":33012,"input":{"total":31390,"cached":0},"output":{"total":1622,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"analyze":{"aggregate":{"total":30696,"input":{"total":29165,"cached":0},"output":{"total":1531,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":30696,"input":{"total":29165,"cached":0},"output":{"total":1531,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"prisma":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"interface":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"test":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"realize":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cac

02. Discussion Board – User Roles and Permissions\n\n## Overview\nThis document provides a comprehensive definition of user roles, their permissions, and responsibilities within the Discussion Board system. Clearly establishing these roles ensures consistent API authentication, robust access control, and lays the foundation for both secure and efficient operations. The system supports a multi-tiered user model tailored to foster open yet moderated discussions on political and economic topics.\n\n## Roles Definition\nThe three principal roles are: **member**, **moderator**, and **admin**. Each role is tied to specific authentication scopes and operational boundaries.\n\n### 1. Member\n**Description**: General registered users engaging in discussions.\n- **Authentication Requirement**: Must register and verify via API (email, password).\n- **Core Permissions**:\n  - View, create, and edit own posts and comments\n  - Participate in voting or reacting to posts if enabled\n  - Report inappropriate content to moderators\n  - Manage own profile and settings\n- **Restrictions**: Cannot access moderation tools or system settings\n\n### 2. Moderator\n**Description**: Trusted users assigned to maintain community standards.\n- **Authentication Requirement**: Elevated credentials (granted by admin) with two-factor authentication recommended\n- **Core Permissions**:\n  - All member permissions\n  - Edit or remove posts/comments violating guidelines\n  - Review and resolve reports of inappropriate content\n  - Warn or temporarily suspend members within grounds\n  - Access moderation dashboard, log actions\n- **Restrictions**: Cannot manage system configuration or user roles outside moderation scope\n\n### 3. Admin\n**Description**: Superuser responsible for complete oversight and system operation.\n- **Authentication Requirement**: Highest credential (must enforce strong password and 2FA)\n- **Core Permissions**:\n  - All moderator permissions\n  - Create, modify, or delete user roles (including assigning moderators)\n  - Manage user accounts (activate, deactivate, or permanently ban)\n  - Configure forum structure, global system settings, and integrations\n  - View system-wide reports and analytics\n\n## Permission Matrix\n| Permission / Action                              | Member | Moderator | Admin    |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|----------|\n| View posts / comments                           |   ✓    |    ✓      |    ✓     |\n| Create posts / comments                         |   ✓    |    ✓      |    ✓     |\n| Edit own posts / comments                       |   ✓    |    ✓      |    ✓     |\n| Delete own posts / comments                     |   ✓    |    ✓      |    ✓     |\n| Report content                                  |   ✓    |    ✓      |    ✓     |\n| Edit/delete any post/comment                    |        |    ✓      |    ✓     |\n| Access moderation dashboard                     |        |    ✓      |    ✓     |\n| Warn/suspend users                              |        |    ✓      |    ✓     |\n| Review/resolve reports                          |        |    ✓      |    ✓     |\n| Manage user accounts (ban, deactivate, etc.)    |        |           |    ✓     |\n| Configure system/settings/roles                 |        |           |    ✓     |\n| Manage forum categories and topics              |        |           |    ✓     |\n| Access system analytics and logs                |        |           |    ✓     |\n\n## API Authentication Scopes\n- **member**: Tokens allow posting, commenting, editing own content, and reporting; limited to personal data endpoints.\n- **moderator**: Tokens allow additional access to moderation endpoints: review, edit, delete, and reporting dashboards.\n- **admin**: Full API access, including all user management, configuration, and sensitive operations. Multi-factor authentication is enforced for all privileged operations.\n\n## Role Escalation & Management\n- Only admins may assign or revoke moderator privileges.\n- Moderator and admin actions are recorded in the audit log.\n- Role changes are communicated to affected users (e.g., via email or system notification).\n\n## Security Considerations\n- Enforce least privilege: users should have only the permissions necessary for their function.\n- Periodically review roles and entitlements to detect and mitigate privilege creep.\n- Strong authentication and logging for all moderator and admin activities.\n\nSee the [Table of Contents](./00_DiscussionBoard_Table_of_Contents.md) for related documentation and

Discussion Board: User Journeys and Workflows\n\n## Overview\nThis document outlines the core user journeys and system workflows for the Discussion Board platform, enabling structured participation around political and economic topics. The journeys are mapped to three primary roles: member, moderator, and admin. Each role's activities are described through key scenarios that reflect common user goals and operational requirements.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Member Journeys\n\n### 1.1 Registration and Access\n- **Account Creation**: Member visits registration page, provides email, password, and agrees to terms. Upon successful verification, member gains access.\n- **Login/Logout**: Secure authentication via email and password. Session is maintained until logout or inactivity timeout.\n\n### 1.2 Browsing and Discovering Topics\n- Members access the forum homepage, viewing a categorized list of political and economic discussion boards.\n- Filtering and search tools enable quick navigation to topics of interest.\n\n### 1.3 Creating and Participating in Discussions\n- **Post Topic**: Member selects a category, creates a new thread by submitting a title and body, optionally attaching files.\n- **View Details**: Member clicks into topics to see full posts, comments, and participant activity.\n- **Comment/Reply**: Members submit comments or reply to existing comments, building threaded discussions.\n- **Edit/Delete Own Content**: Members can modify or delete their own posts/comments within editable periods.\n\n### 1.4 Engagement\n- **Voting/Liking**: Optionally, members can upvote, like, or react to posts/comments.\n- **Reporting**: Members report inappropriate content using an in-post/report button, flagging for moderation review.\n\n\n## 2. Moderator Workflows\n\n### 2.1 Monitoring Activity\n- Moderators review new posts, comments, and reports from the member community using dashboards and notification tools.\n\n### 2.2 Content Moderation\n- **Approve/Reject Posts and Comments**: Moderators validate content for rule compliance, removing or editing as needed.\n- **Issue Warnings/Bans**: When violations occur, moderators may warn users or suspend accounts, following escalation protocols.\n- **Handle Reports**: For each reported item, moderators review the case, log actions taken, and update report statuses.\n\n### 2.3 Communication\n- Via announcements or direct messages, moderators notify members of actions taken or policy updates.\n\n\n## 3. Admin Workflows\n\n### 3.1 Forum and User Management\n- **User Administration**: Admins view, edit, or remove any user account, assign or revoke moderator privileges.\n- **Category/Board Setup**: Create, update, or delete boards and topic categories.\n\n### 3.2 Configuration and Settings\n- Manage system-wide settings, permissions, feature flags, and community guidelines.\n- Review system/usage analytics and audit logs for governance.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Workflow Diagrams\n\n### Member Content Contribution\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Start] --> B(Login/Register);\n    B --> C[Browse Boards];\n    C --> D[Create Post or Comment];\n    D --> E[Engage (Vote/Report)];\n    E --> F[Logout/Session End];\n```\n\n### Moderation Issue Resolution\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    M1[Moderator Receives Report] --> M2[Review Content];\n    M2 --> M3{Violation?};\n    M3 -- Yes --> M4[Edit/Delete Content];\n    M3 -- No --> M5[Dismiss/Close Report];\n    M4 --> M6[Notify User];\n    M6 --> M7[Document Outcome];\n    M5 --> M7;\n```\n\n### Administrative Oversight\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A1[Admin Login] --> A2[Review System Analytics];\n    A2 --> A3[Manage Users & Forums];\n    A3 --> A4[Update Settings];\n    A4 --> A5[Logout/Session End];\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5.

Discussion Board: User Journeys and Workflows\n\n## Overview\nThis document outlines the core user journeys and system workflows for the Discussion Board platform, enabling structured participation around political and economic topics. The journeys are mapped to three primary roles: member, moderator, and admin. Each role's activities are described through key scenarios that reflect common user goals and operational requirements.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Member Journeys\n\n### 1.1 Registration and Access\n- **Account Creation**: Member visits registration page, provides email, password, and agrees to terms. Upon successful verification, member gains access.\n- **Login/Logout**: Secure authentication via email and password. Session is maintained until logout or inactivity timeout.\n\n### 1.2 Browsing and Discovering Topics\n- Members access the forum homepage, viewing a categorized list of political and economic discussion boards.\n- Filtering and search tools enable quick navigation to topics of interest.\n\n### 1.3 Creating and Participating in Discussions\n- **Post Topic**: Member selects a category, creates a new thread by submitting a title and body, optionally attaching files.\n- **View Details**: Member clicks into topics to see full posts, comments, and participant activity.\n- **Comment/Reply**: Members submit comments or reply to existing comments, building threaded discussions.\n- **Edit/Delete Own Content**: Members can modify or delete their own posts/comments within editable periods.\n\n### 1.4 Engagement\n- **Voting/Liking**: Optionally, members can upvote, like, or react to posts/comments.\n- **Reporting**: Members report inappropriate content using an in-post/report button, flagging for moderation review.\n\n\n## 2. Moderator Workflows\n\n### 2.1 Monitoring Activity\n- Moderators review new posts, comments, and reports from the member community using dashboards and notification tools.\n\n### 2.2 Content Moderation\n- **Approve/Reject Posts and Comments**: Moderators validate content for rule compliance, removing or editing as needed.\n- **Issue Warnings/Bans**: When violations occur, moderators may warn users or suspend accounts, following escalation protocols.\n- **Handle Reports**: For each reported item, moderators review the case, log actions taken, and update report statuses.\n\n### 2.3 Communication\n- Via announcements or direct messages, moderators notify members of actions taken or policy updates.\n\n\n## 3. Admin Workflows\n\n### 3.1 Forum and User Management\n- **User Administration**: Admins view, edit, or remove any user account, assign or revoke moderator privileges.\n- **Category/Board Setup**: Create, update, or delete boards and topic categories.\n\n### 3.2 Configuration and Settings\n- Manage system-wide settings, permissions, feature flags, and community guidelines.\n- Review system/usage analytics and audit logs for governance.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Workflow Diagrams\n\n### Member Content Contribution\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Start] --> B(Login/Register);\n    B --> C[Browse Boards];\n    C --> D[Create Post or Comment];\n    D --> E[Engage (Vote/Report)];\n    E --> F[Logout/Session End];\n```\n\n### Moderation Issue Resolution\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    M1[Moderator Receives Report] --> M2[Review Content];\n    M2 --> M3{Violation?};\n    M3 -- Yes --> M4[Edit/Delete Content];\n    M3 -- No --> M5[Dismiss/Close Report];\n    M4 --> M6[Notify User];\n    M6 --> M7[Document Outcome];\n    M5 --> M7;\n```\n\n### Administrative Oversight\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A1[Admin Login] --> A2[Review System Analytics];\n    A2 --> A3[Manage Users & Forums];\n    A3 --> A4[Update Settings];\n    A4 --> A5[Logout/Session End];\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5.

02. Discussion Board – User Roles and Permissions\n\n## Overview\nThis document provides a comprehensive definition of user roles, their permissions, and responsibilities within the Discussion Board system. Clearly establishing these roles ensures consistent API authentication, robust access control, and lays the foundation for both secure and efficient operations. The system supports a multi-tiered user model tailored to foster open yet moderated discussions on political and economic topics.\n\n## Roles Definition\nThe three principal roles are: **member**, **moderator**, and **admin**. Each role is tied to specific authentication scopes and operational boundaries.\n\n### 1. Member\n**Description**: General registered users engaging in discussions.\n- **Authentication Requirement**: Must register and verify via API (email, password).\n- **Core Permissions**:\n  - View, create, and edit own posts and comments\n  - Participate in voting or reacting to posts if enabled\n  - Report inappropriate content to moderators\n  - Manage own profile and settings\n- **Restrictions**: Cannot access moderation tools or system settings\n\n### 2. Moderator\n**Description**: Trusted users assigned to maintain community standards.\n- **Authentication Requirement**: Elevated credentials (granted by admin) with two-factor authentication recommended\n- **Core Permissions**:\n  - All member permissions\n  - Edit or remove posts/comments violating guidelines\n  - Review and resolve reports of inappropriate content\n  - Warn or temporarily suspend members within grounds\n  - Access moderation dashboard, log actions\n- **Restrictions**: Cannot manage system configuration or user roles outside moderation scope\n\n### 3. Admin\n**Description**: Superuser responsible for complete oversight and system operation.\n- **Authentication Requirement**: Highest credential (must enforce strong password and 2FA)\n- **Core Permissions**:\n  - All moderator permissions\n  - Create, modify, or delete user roles (including assigning moderators)\n  - Manage user accounts (activate, deactivate, or permanently ban)\n  - Configure forum structure, global system settings, and integrations\n  - View system-wide reports and analytics\n\n## Permission Matrix\n| Permission / Action                              | Member | Moderator | Admin    |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|----------|\n| View posts / comments                           |   ✓    |    ✓      |    ✓     |\n| Create posts / comments                         |   ✓    |    ✓      |    ✓     |\n| Edit own posts / comments                       |   ✓    |    ✓      |    ✓     |\n| Delete own posts / comments                     |   ✓    |    ✓      |    ✓     |\n| Report content                                  |   ✓    |    ✓      |    ✓     |\n| Edit/delete any post/comment                    |        |    ✓      |    ✓     |\n| Access moderation dashboard                     |        |    ✓      |    ✓     |\n| Warn/suspend users                              |        |    ✓      |    ✓     |\n| Review/resolve reports                          |        |    ✓      |    ✓     |\n| Manage user accounts (ban, deactivate, etc.)    |        |           |    ✓     |\n| Configure system/settings/roles                 |        |           |    ✓     |\n| Manage forum categories and topics              |        |           |    ✓     |\n| Access system analytics and logs                |        |           |    ✓     |\n\n## API Authentication Scopes\n- **member**: Tokens allow posting, commenting, editing own content, and reporting; limited to personal data endpoints.\n- **moderator**: Tokens allow additional access to moderation endpoints: review, edit, delete, and reporting dashboards.\n- **admin**: Full API access, including all user management, configuration, and sensitive operations. Multi-factor authentication is enforced for all privileged operations.\n\n## Role Escalation & Management\n- Only admins may assign or revoke moderator privileges.\n- Moderator and admin actions are recorded in the audit log.\n- Role changes are communicated to affected users (e.g., via email or system notification).\n\n## Security Considerations\n- Enforce least privilege: users should have only the permissions necessary for their function.\n- Periodically review roles and entitlements to detect and mitigate privilege creep.\n- Strong authentication and logging for all moderator and admin activities.\n\nSee the [Table of Contents](./00_DiscussionBoard_Table_of_Contents.md) for related documentation and

Discussion Board Project Overview and Objectives\n\n## Overview\nThe Discussion Board is designed as a dedicated online platform for in-depth political and economic discussion, setting itself apart from conventional forums through intentional community design, moderation excellence, and a commitment to discussion quality. Unlike general-purpose boards, this forum targets users such as policy enthusiasts, academics, students, professionals, and members of the public who seek constructive debate on complex national and international issues. Its moderation philosophy is rooted in balancing open dialogue with community welfare: moderators are empowered not just to remove harmful or off-topic posts, but to actively foster a climate where evidence-based arguments, respectful disagreement, and diversity of perspectives are valued. The platform will incorporate rigorous content flagging, transparent moderation logs, clear community guidelines, and feedback loops to ensure optimum discussion quality. \"High-quality discussion\" is defined not only by civility, but by the prevalence of well-reasoned, well-sourced contributions and the minimization of personal attacks, misinformation, or echo chambers. \n\n## Vision\nOur vision is to become the premier digital space for informed and meaningful debate in political and economic domains. We aim to address the challenges of polarization, the spread of misinformation, trolling, and the often hostile environments found on competing platforms. The Discussion Board's core values—integrity, transparency, and inclusiveness—are demonstrated through features such as public moderation logs, statistical reporting on flagged content, inclusive onboarding for new voices, and technical measures against bots and shills. Concrete targets include: a 90% user satisfaction rate regarding fairness of moderation; a <5% prevalence of reported misinformation on trending threads (as verified by fact-checking); and measurable diversity in users' backgrounds and viewpoints. The platform strives for a reputation where users trust the reliability, openness, and fairness of discourse, supported by systems that reward constructive engagement and the elevation of underrepresented perspectives.\n\n## Business Goals\n- **Foster a Vibrant Community**: Achieve sustained daily participation of 5,000+ engaged members within 12 months. Example initiatives include topic-of-the-week contests and expert AMAs. Metrics: DAU/MAU, new post volume, and retention rates.\n- **Ensure High-Quality Dialogue**: Implement incentive systems for upvoted, well-researched posts, such as recognition badges and access to premium features. Projected outcome: 70% of threads surpass a discussion quality threshold (measured via peer review and moderator scoring).\n- **Monetize Responsibly**: Offer optional paid memberships granting access to exclusive reports, ad-free browsing, and advanced analytics, aiming for a 3%+ conversion rate by end of year one. Metrics: MRR, user upgrade rate, churn analysis.\n- **Safeguard Security & Compliance**: Establish GDPR-compliant data policies with regular audits and user-friendly consent tools. Track: zero reportable data incidents per year, positive user security perception surveys.\n\n## Core Objectives\n- **Promote Constructive Dialogue**: Encourage practices such as citing sources, using structured arguments, and refraining from personal attacks. Employ behavioral guidelines and visible incentives (e.g., badges for civil discourse) with AI-assisted moderation support to recognize and highlight exemplary contributions.\n- **Maintain Platform Integrity & Trust**: Instill robust mechanisms against manipulation (e.g., coordinated inauthentic behavior, astroturfing), regular disclosure of moderation actions, and a user reputation system. Objective: cultivate trust through visible accountability and open feedback.\n- **Prioritize Robust Security & Data Governance**: Use state-of-the-art encryption, strict access control, and secure audit trails for all sensitive operations. Ensure users can manage their privacy preferences easily and transparently. Regularly review systems for vulnerabilities, maintaining compliance with all applicable legal standards.\n\n## Discussion Board User Roles and Permissions\nThis section will provide a detailed breakdown of all user types and their associated permissions, mapped directly to system authentication and authorization protocols. It will define what regular members, moderators, and admins can do, supported by scenarios such as posting, editing, moderating, and accessing configuration settings.

Discussion Board: Requirements and Business Rules\n\n## 1. Overview\nThis document details all core requirements and business rules for the political/economic discussion board platform. It is self-contained and supplies everything needed for effective development, validation, and future feature expansion.\n\n## 2. Functional Requirements\n### 2.1 User Registration & Authentication\n- Users (members, moderators, admins) must be able to register and authenticate using secure mechanisms (email/password, optional 2FA).\n- Only verified accounts gain access to posting and commenting functions.\n\n### 2.2 User Roles & Permissions\n- **Member:** Can create topics, post, comment, like/dislike, report inappropriate content.\n- **Moderator:** Can perform all Member actions plus edit/delete any post/comment, resolve reports, and issue warnings or temporary suspensions.\n- **Admin:** Full permissions, including user management, board structure configuration, analytics, and security setting adjustments.\n\n### 2.3 Content Operations\n- Users can create topics with a title, description, and tags.\n- Posts and comments support markdown formatting and attachments (e.g., images, PDFs).\n- Users can edit or delete their own posts/comments unless locked or under moderation.\n\n### 2.4 Discussion Management\n- Threads are chronologically and hierarchically organized (replies to comments supported).\n- Voting (like/dislike) and flagging functions available for every post/comment.\n- Hot topics and trending posts are algorithmically surfaced.\n\n### 2.5 Moderation Features\n- Reporting flow for inappropriate content, spam, or abuse.\n- Moderators review flagged content, with required audit trail logging (actions, timestamps, moderator identity).\n- Temporary or permanent user suspensions can be issued.\n\n### 2.6 Notifications & Communication\n- Users can opt-in for email or in-app notifications: replies, mentions, moderation updates, board announcements.\n\n## 3. Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Availability:** 99.5% uptime target (excluding scheduled maintenance).\n- **Performance:** Response times under 1 second for main actions.\n- **Scalability:** Support for bursts in user numbers, up to 10,000+ concurrent users.\n- **Security:** All personal data encrypted in transit and at rest; regular security audits.\n- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA level compliance.\n\n## 4. Business Rules\n- Discussions must remain on political/economic topics; off-topic content can be removed or moved at moderator/admin discretion.\n- Registered users must accept a Code of Conduct outlining respectful behavior, anti-harassment, and zero tolerance for hate speech.\n- Each user can report up to 10 items of content per day to avoid abuse of the reporting system.\n- Suspended users cannot post, comment, or vote; their prior posts remain unless deleted by a moderator or admin.\n- Topic tags are curated; users can propose new tags, but moderator/admin approval is required.\n- Automated filters mask profanity and flag suspected spam before publication, pending moderator review.\n- Data retention: all posts and logs retained for a minimum of 2 years for legal and audit requirements.\n\n## 5. Future Considerations\n- Integration with external authentication providers (OAuth, SSO).\n- Advanced analytics for post engagement, user activity heatmaps.\n- Support for live events, video debates, and scheduled panel discussions.\n- Multilingual support for non-English discussions subject to moderation resourcing.\n\n## 6. Acceptance Criteria\n- All listed role permissions are enforced at the API, backend, and UI layers.\n- Moderation and audit logs are immutable and accessible only to administrators.\n- Functional tests cover all user journeys: registration, posting, reporting, moderation, and notification flows.\n\n---\n**End of

Unlike general-purpose boards, this forum targets users such as policy enthusiasts, academics, students, professionals, and members of the public who seek constructive debate on complex national and international issues. Its moderation philosophy is rooted in balancing open dialogue with community welfare: moderators are empowered not just to remove harmful or off-topic posts, but to actively foster a climate where evidence-based arguments, respectful disagreement, and diversity of perspectives are valued. The platform will incorporate rigorous content flagging, transparent moderation logs, clear community guidelines, and feedback loops to ensure optimum discussion quality. \"High-quality discussion\" is defined not only by civility, but by the prevalence of well-reasoned, well-sourced contributions and the minimization of personal attacks, misinformation, or echo chambers. \n\n## Vision\nOur vision is to become the premier digital space for informed and meaningful debate in political and economic domains. We aim to address the challenges of polarization, the spread of misinformation, trolling, and the often hostile environments found on competing platforms. The Discussion Board's core values—integrity, transparency, and inclusiveness—are demonstrated through features such as public moderation logs, statistical reporting on flagged content, inclusive onboarding for new voices, and technical measures against bots and shills. Concrete targets include: a 90% user satisfaction rate regarding fairness of moderation; a <5% prevalence of reported misinformation on trending threads (as verified by fact-checking); and measurable diversity in users' backgrounds and viewpoints. The platform strives for a reputation where users trust the reliability, openness, and fairness of discourse, supported by systems that reward constructive engagement and the elevation of underrepresented perspectives.\n\n## Business Goals\n- **Foster a Vibrant Community**: Achieve sustained daily participation of 5,000+ engaged members within 12 months. Example initiatives include topic-of-the-week contests and expert AMAs. Metrics: DAU/MAU, new post volume, and retention rates.\n- **Ensure High-Quality Dialogue**: Implement incentive systems for upvoted, well-researched posts, such as recognition badges and access to premium features. Projected outcome: 70% of threads surpass a discussion quality threshold (measured via peer review and moderator scoring).\n- **Monetize Responsibly**: Offer optional paid memberships granting access to exclusive reports, ad-free browsing, and advanced analytics, aiming for a 3%+ conversion rate by end of year one. Metrics: MRR, user upgrade rate, churn analysis.\n- **Safeguard Security & Compliance**: Establish GDPR-compliant data policies with regular audits and user-friendly consent tools. Track: zero reportable data incidents per year, positive user security perception surveys.\n\n## Core Objectives\n- **Promote Constructive Dialogue**: Encourage practices such as citing sources, using structured arguments, and refraining from personal attacks. Employ behavioral guidelines and visible incentives (e.g., badges for civil discourse) with AI-assisted moderation support to recognize and highlight exemplary contributions.\n- **Maintain Platform Integrity & Trust**: Instill robust mechanisms against manipulation (e.g., coordinated inauthentic behavior, astroturfing), regular disclosure of moderation actions, and a user reputation system. Objective: cultivate trust through visible accountability and open feedback.\n- **Prioritize Robust Security & Data Governance**: Use state-of-the-art encryption, strict access control, and secure audit trails for all sensitive operations. Ensure users can manage their privacy preferences easily and transparently. Regularly review systems for vulnerabilities, maintaining compliance with all applicable legal standards.\n\n## Discussion Board User Roles and Permissions\nThis section will provide a detailed breakdown of all user types and their associated permissions, mapped directly to system authentication and authorization protocols. It will define what regular members, moderators, and admins can do, supported by scenarios such as posting, editing, moderating, and accessing configuration settings. This enables clarity for developers implementing role-based access controls and supports transparency for all users regarding platform governance.","02_DiscussionBoard_User_Roles_and_Permissions.md":"# 02. Discussion Board – User Roles and Permissions\n\n## Overview\nThis document provides a comprehensive definition of user roles, their permissions, and responsibilities within the Discussion Board system.

Functional Requirements\n### 2.1 User Registration & Authentication\n- Users (members, moderators, admins) must be able to register and authenticate using secure mechanisms (email/password, optional 2FA).\n- Only verified accounts gain access to posting and commenting functions.\n\n### 2.2 User Roles & Permissions\n- **Member:** Can create topics, post, comment, like/dislike, report inappropriate content.\n- **Moderator:** Can perform all Member actions plus edit/delete any post/comment, resolve reports, and issue warnings or temporary suspensions.\n- **Admin:** Full permissions, including user management, board structure configuration, analytics, and security setting adjustments.\n\n### 2.3 Content Operations\n- Users can create topics with a title, description, and tags.\n- Posts and comments support markdown formatting and attachments (e.g., images, PDFs).\n- Users can edit or delete their own posts/comments unless locked or under moderation.\n\n### 2.4 Discussion Management\n- Threads are chronologically and hierarchically organized (replies to comments supported).\n- Voting (like/dislike) and flagging functions available for every post/comment.\n- Hot topics and trending posts are algorithmically surfaced.\n\n### 2.5 Moderation Features\n- Reporting flow for inappropriate content, spam, or abuse.\n- Moderators review flagged content, with required audit trail logging (actions, timestamps, moderator identity).\n- Temporary or permanent user suspensions can be issued.\n\n### 2.6 Notifications & Communication\n- Users can opt-in for email or in-app notifications: replies, mentions, moderation updates, board announcements.\n\n## 3. Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Availability:** 99.5% uptime target (excluding scheduled maintenance).\n- **Performance:** Response times under 1 second for main actions.\n- **Scalability:** Support for bursts in user numbers, up to 10,000+ concurrent users.\n- **Security:** All personal data encrypted in transit and at rest; regular security audits.\n- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA level compliance.\n\n## 4. Business Rules\n- Discussions must remain on political/economic topics; off-topic content can be removed or moved at moderator/admin discretion.\n- Registered users must accept a Code of Conduct outlining respectful behavior, anti-harassment, and zero tolerance for hate speech.\n- Each user can report up to 10 items of content per day to avoid abuse of the reporting system.\n- Suspended users cannot post, comment, or vote; their prior posts remain unless deleted by a moderator or admin.\n- Topic tags are curated; users can propose new tags, but moderator/admin approval is required.\n- Automated filters mask profanity and flag suspected spam before publication, pending moderator review.\n- Data retention: all posts and logs retained for a minimum of 2 years for legal and audit requirements.\n\n## 5. Future Considerations\n- Integration with external authentication providers (OAuth, SSO).\n- Advanced analytics for post engagement, user activity heatmaps.\n- Support for live events, video debates, and scheduled panel discussions.\n- Multilingual support for non-English discussions subject to moderation resourcing.\n\n## 6. Acceptance Criteria\n- All listed role permissions are enforced at the API, backend, and UI layers.\n- Moderation and audit logs are immutable and accessible only to administrators.\n- Functional tests cover all user journeys: registration, posting, reporting, moderation, and notification flows.\n\n---\n**End of
