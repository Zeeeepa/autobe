It covers how promotions, coupons, rewards (mileage/deposit), and advanced AI-driven personalization support business growth and retention. References to user roles, product/content management, and platform extensibility are summarized within relevant sections for developer clarity.\n\n---\n\n## Key Features\n- **Promotion Types**\n  - **Standard Discounts**: Percentage or fixed-amount, scheduled or triggered by events. E.g., Summer Sale (10% off all electronics from July 1-14).\n  - **Coupons**: Single-use, multi-use, stackable or exclusive. E.g., \"WELCOME10\"—new user 10% off, valid for first order only.\n  - **Loyalty Points (Mileage)**: Earned by purchases, can be redeemed on subsequent transactions. E.g., 5 points per $1 spent—customer earns 200 points on a $40 order, redeemable for $2 off next order.\n  - **Deposits**: Store credit from refunds or admin compensation. Can be partial or full, tracked separately from earned rewards.\n  - **Tiered Loyalty Systems**: Customer unlocks Silver, Gold, Platinum levels with increased purchase frequency/amounts, unlocking better rewards or privileges.\n  - **AI-Personalized Offers**: System recommends exclusive promotions based on browsing/buying patterns; e.g., customer interested in outdoor gear gets sent a private \"15% off backpacks\" coupon via in-site notification.\n\n---\n\n## User Scenarios\n| Actor      | Scenario                                                     | Step-by-Step Example |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Customer   | Browses shoes, gets AI-timed pop-up for 5% off coupon. Uses coupon at checkout, and earns 50 points (5 per $1 x $10). Later, sees a loyalty dashboard summarizing rewards and thus returns to shop more. |\n| Seller     | Launches a 'Buy 2 Get 1 Free' campaign via dashboard. Monitors real-time coupon usage analytics and adapts strategy if redemption rates are low (e.g., automatically toggling to free shipping offer). Also sets up product-bundle-exclusive coupons for loyal repeat customers. |\n| Admin      | Sets global holiday discounts, configures coupon stacking rules, adjusts monthly loyalty point multipliers, and receives anomaly alerts if coupon abuse is detected (e.g., by monitoring sudden spikes in redemptions from a single IP address). |\n\n**Sample Flow Diagram** (Customer Loyalty Point Use):\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n  A[Customer checkout] --> B{Eligible for points?}\n  B -- Yes --> C[Assign points]\n  C --> D[Show cumulative points]\n  B -- No --> E[Skip awarding]\n  D --> F[Offer redemption option]\n```\n\n---\n\n## System Requirements\n### Functional\n- Enable admins and sellers to create, edit, and schedule diverse promotions.\n- Auto-apply, personal, and trigger-based promotions (e.g., first purchase, birthday).\n- Allow customers to view rewards/coupon status (dashboard, my page).\n- Coupon validation at checkout (e.g., expiry, usage, stacking rules).\n- Points/deposit application/reversal after returns/refunds.\n- Analytics: Track issuance, usage, and ROI by customer/product/campaign.\n\n### Non-Functional\n- Response time under 2s for coupon validation and loyalty actions.\n- Horizontally scalable rewards ledger and analytics engines to handle high event loads during major sales.\n- Data integrity: transactional consistency between order, reward, and refund records.\n- Role-based access: Only sellers/admins can configure campaigns; customers only claim/use.\n- Compliance with regional promo regulations (e.g., expiry dates, clear display of benefits).\n\n---\n\n## System Flows\n### Example: Coupon Application Failure\nA customer enters a coupon at checkout that is expired. System immediately returns a clear error message, increments a \"bad attempt\" counter (for abuse detection), and suggests valid alternative coupons if available.\n\n### Example: Loyalty Point Redemption Edge Case\nIf customer attempts to redeem more points than their balance, system offers a \"use maximum allowed\" prompt, and logs the attempt for analytics.\n\n**Representative Transaction Flows**\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant C as Customer\n  participant S as System\n  C->>S: Enters coupon code at checkout\n  S-->>C: Validate code, apply if eligible\n  S-->>C: Error if invalid; alternatives if possible\n  C->>S: Selects loyalty points for next order\n  S-->>C: Deduct points, confirm, update dashboard\n```\n\n---\n\n## AI-Driven Promotion Examples\n- **Next Best Offer:** AI identifies a buyer with a high tendency to purchase luxury bags and sends a time-limited 20% coupon only valid for that category. Pattern-matching is based on item views, cart additions, and past successful promotions to similar users.\n- **Churn Prevention:** Detects at-risk users (e.g., 30 days inactivity) and delivers personalized \"Come Back\" bundles combining extra points with an exclusive coupon. Success rate tracked against a baseline group.\n- **A/B Testing:** AI experiments with different discount levels for similar user segments, dynamically promotes most effective offers.\n- **Data Flow Example:**\n  1. Event Stream: User clicks, purchases, coupon redemptions.\n  2. AI Model Input: Event data + user profile\n  3. AI Output: Real-time offer push (notification/email)\n\n---\n\n## KPIs and Analytics\n- **Metrics Calculated:**\n  - Coupon redemption rate (total used / total issued)\n  - Campaign ROI: (`(Additional sales from promotion - cost of discounts)/cost of discounts`)\n  - Repeat purchase rate before and after promotion\n  - Point liability tracking (outstanding/unredeemed)\n- **Analytic Methodologies:** \n  - Time series analysis of redemption and ROI\n  - User cohort segmentation (e.g., by location, age, last activity)\n  - Fraud detection models (flagging bulk or abnormal coupon uses)\n- **Sample Dashboard:**\n  - Line charts of coupon usage by day/category\n  - Heat maps of redemption by user segment\n  - Anomaly alerts on outlier activity\n\n---\n\n## User Roles & Management\nThe loyalty and promotion system depends on robust [User Roles & Management](./02_ai-mall_user-roles-and-management.md). Each feature, from personalization to campaign setup, requires role validation—only sellers and admins launch campaigns, while customers can only claim or redeem. Points, deposits and redemptions are associated with authenticated user profiles, enabling audit trails and fraud controls.\n\n## Product and Content Management\nPromotion applicability depends on [Product and Content Management](./03_ai-mall_product-and-content-management.md). Each promotion or coupon can be restricted to certain categories, brands, or SKUs, ensuring offers align with inventory and marketing goals. Returns, refunds, or bundled promotions require up-to-date catalog data to calculate accurate rewards.\n\n## Architecture & Extensibility\nThe promotion engine is architected to be extensible ([Architecture & Extensibility](./07_ai-mall_architecture-and-extensibility.md)). New reward types, rule engines, and AI models are plug-and-play via module interfaces, and analytics are exportable to external BI tools. Endpoints use secure, scalable APIs, enabling future integration of partner loyalty programs or 3rd-party AI personalization engines.\n\n---","06_ai-mall_interaction-and-personalization.md":"# AI Mall: Interaction and Personalization\n\n## 1. Interaction Modules\n\n### 1.1 Inquiries\nCustomers submit product or order-related questions, visible to sellers and optionally admins. Each inquiry stores status (open/answered), timestamps, related SKUs, and user metadata. Sellers receive notifications and respond via threaded comments. Edge case: bulk inquiries on promotions prompt automated FAQ suggestions. Example data flow: a customer asks a question (POST), seller replies (PATCH), customer receives a push/email per their preference center settings.\n\n### 1.2 Reviews and Ratings\nAfter fulfillment, customers leave reviews with multi-dimensional ratings (quality, value, delivery) and optional photos. Sellers may reply once per review; admins can hide flagged content. Edge case: reviews flagged for suspicious patterns (e.g., spam, repeated text) route to moderation. Developers must consider concurrency—editing reviews should lock the item. Sample payload: `{reviewId, userId, rating, body, images[], status, timestamps}`. Reviews update seller analytics and product reputation scores.\n\n### 1.3 Feedback Mechanism\nSystem-wide feedback (site suggestions, bugs) is submitted via an always-available form. Admins categorize (UX, technical, content), prioritize, and respond within SLA. Payload includes device info and URLs for reproducing bugs. Feedback affecting personal data triggers privacy escalation.\n\n### 1.4 Notifications and Preference Center\nUsers (customers/sellers) receive granular, channel-specific notifications—order status changes, inquiry replies, promos, moderation updates—via web, email, or app. The preference center enables toggling notification types and channels. Example flow: a customer disables promo emails but keeps order alerts. Permission scenario: only admins may bulk-edit seller notification settings. Edge case: notification delivery failures require user-facing logs.\n\n### 1.5 Favorites, Wish Lists, and Collections\nCustomers can favorite products, save to wish lists (product buckets, e.g., “Birthday Gifts”) or create custom collections. Collections include privacy toggles (public/private). API enforces user permission: only the account owner can modify wish lists. Sample data: `{collectionId, userId, label, items[], isPublic, created, modified}`. Edge case: merging wish lists after account sign-in from multiple devices.\n\n## 2. Personalization Features\n\n### 2.1 Personalized Recommendations\nAI-driven modules generate recommendations from behavior (browsing, cart, order, favorites), segment data (age, location), and context (season, trending). Example: system suggests items similar to recent purchases or upsells on checkout. Payload: `{userId, eventType, context, timestamp}`. Edge cases: new users (cold start) use popularity-based fallback logic; logged-out sessions use cookies/localStorage with opt-in.\n\n### 2.2 Dynamic Content Personalization\nLanding pages, emails, and push notifications adapt content blocks by user persona, interaction history, and real-time events. Example: homepage banners show “Back-to-School” deals for student-segmented users. Permission: sellers may apply rules to their own store, admins override global logic. Sample flow: user logs in > triggers segment lookup > receives dynamic banner assignment.\n\n### 2.3 Search and Navigation Customization\nSearch results and navigation menus reorder in real-time based on past preferences and behavior. The system weights products by purchase history, interactions, and promos shown/clicked. Edge case: a seller promotes a flash sale—affected products jump search ranking for targeted segments. Permissions: only sellers with marketing roles may influence their product sorting.\n\n## 3. Moderation & Compliance\n\n### 3.1 Moderation Flows\nCombines automated filters (toxic content, spam) with human moderation for user inquiries, reviews, and profiles. Typical actions: flag, approve, blacklist, or restore. Edge case: auto-flagged post gets instant temporary hide, pending moderator review within 24h. Moderators can escalate to admin for permanent actions.\n\n### 3.2 Audit Trails and Permission Boundaries\nAll moderation, personalization, and notification changes log to immutable audit trails. Example audit log format:\n\n```\n{\n  action: \"review_hide\",\n  actorRole: \"moderator\",\n  actorId: \"mod5983\",\n  targetId: \"review9123\",\n  timestamp: \"2025-07-24T03:19:02+09:00\",\n  reason: \"inappropriate language\"\n}\n```\n\nPermissions: customers can flag but not view moderation status; sellers manage their store’s flagged content; admins see and revert all moderation actions.\n\n## 4. Acceptance Criteria & Examples\n\n- **Submitting an Inquiry**: User sends inquiry > seller receives notification > seller reply visible within 5 minutes; system passes test if states advance accordingly.\n- **Review Moderation**: Admin hides a flagged review; audit log is created, and the review is no longer returned in product detail API.\n- **Preference Update**: User toggles off push promotions; system must not deliver these, which is verified by unit test with sample input `{userId: X, notifType: promo, enabled: false}`.\n- **Edge Cases**: Merging wish lists from two accounts retains all unique items; notification fails logs must link delivery errors to user records.\n- **Sample Test Case**: Submitting inappropriate review triggers auto-hide and alerts moderator. Input: review text with banned keywords. Output: review.hidden==true, audit log created.\n\n## Appendix\n\n### User Journeys and Flow Diagrams\n\n#### Sample Customer Journey\n1. Customer browses homepage\n2. Searches for “Wireless Earbuds”\n3. Adds favorite products to \"Birthday Gifts\" wish list\n4. Places order > receives order confirmation (email + web push)\n5. Receives “You might also like” section\n6. Leaves a review\n7. Flags spam review on another product\n\n#### Sample Seller Journey\n1. Seller receives new inquiry notification\n2. Responds via dashboard, tracked in real time in audit trail\n3. Monitors product reviews, flags inappropriate content\n4. Sets promotional rule to “boost” seasonal items\n5. Edits notification preferences for order events\n\n---\nAll data structures, examples, and flows above are contained within this page for seamless developer implementation and testing.","07_ai-mall_architecture-and-extensibility.md":"# AI Mall Architecture and Extensibility\n\n## Overview\nThis document describes the architectural principles and extensibility features of the AI Mall system. It explains how the platform is designed for scalability, modularity, and the ability to integrate new channels, categories, and sections. Additionally, it covers file/attachment management, API gateway strategies, and the adoption of a microservices approach to ensure that the AI Mall evolves efficiently and reliably as business requirements or technologies change.\n\n## 1. Architectural Principles\n- **Modularity:** All business domains and features are defined as modules with standardized interfaces for easy maintenance and deployment.\n- **Channel & Section Abstraction:** Sales channels (web, mobile app, third-party platforms) and sections (specialty areas within channels) are designed to be added or reconfigured without impacting core systems.\n- **Category Flexibility:** Products and content are organized into dynamic, hierarchical categories, allowing expansion or reclassification as inventory evolves.\n- **Extensible APIs:** API endpoints are exposed via a gateway, ensuring easy onboarding of new channels, integrations, or partners.\n- **Data Consistency:** Shared data models and contract-driven development are applied across services to maintain consistency as the system expands.\n\n## 2. Extending Channels, Sections, and Categories\n- **Channels:** Each channel is configured with metadata (brand, domain, UI settings) and can be enabled/disabled dynamically. Merchants can request or launch new channels through an admin interface.\n- **Sections:** Sections segment channel experiences (e.g., lifestyle, electronics), each defined by configurable rules, permissions, and featured content.\n- **Category Management:** Categories use a tree structure, supporting drag-and-drop reordering, merging, and bulk actions from the admin UI. Category metadata is versioned for auditability.\n\n## 3. File and Attachment Handling\n- **File Service:** Attachments (product images, manuals, promotions) are managed through a file service supporting large file uploads, inline previews, and automatic media optimization.\n- **Access Control:** Roles (admin, seller, customer) are enforced for file visibility and manipulation. Expiring download links provide secure delivery for sensitive files.\n- **Storage Backends:** The architecture accommodates multiple storage providers—cloud or on-premises—using interchangeable adapters.\n\n## 4. API Gateway Integration\n- **Unified API Entry:** All traffic (internal/external) flows through a gateway, providing consistent authentication, throttling, and protocol translation.\n- **Routing Rules:** Channel and section-specific logic is abstracted at the gateway level, enabling fast onboarding or deprecation of endpoints.\n- **Developer Portal:** API documentation and sandbox environments support partners extending or integrating with AI Mall.\n\n## 5. Microservice Architecture\n- **Loose Coupling:** Business capabilities are isolated as services (orders, catalog, personalization, search) communicating through matured APIs or asynchronous events.\n- **Scalable Deployment:** Each microservice can be scaled, updated, or replaced independently to suit evolving workloads or technical advances.\n- **Service Registration:** Services declare their capabilities and dependencies consistently through a centralized registry.\n\n## 6. Modularity and Future-Proofing\n- **Plug-in Framework:** Optional modules (e.g., new payment gateways, analytics providers) can be registered with minimal friction.\n- **Configuration-Driven Behavior:** Behavioral changes (UI, business rules, feature toggles) are managed via configuration, reducing redeployment needs.\n- **Upgrade Path:** Robust documentation, versioning policies, and backward compatibility ensure safe upgrades and integration of future AI-driven features.\n\n---\n\n**See also:** [06_ai-mall_interaction-and-personalization.md](./06_ai-mall_interaction-and-personalization.md), [08_ai-mall_ai-and-advanced-analytics.md](./08_ai-mall_ai-and-advanced-analytics.md)\n","08_ai-mall_ai-and-advanced-analytics.md":"# AI and Advanced Analytics for AI Mall\n\n## 1.

These frameworks ensure the platform is secure, meets regulatory requirements, maintains user privacy, and is accessible and usable by all users globally.\n\n## 1. Security Architecture\n- **Identity & Access Management:** All API endpoints are protected with robust authentication (OAuth2, JWT). Role-based access (customer, seller, admin) restricts operations to only the necessary functionalities per user type.\n- **Data Protection:** Data-in-transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2+. All sensitive data (PII, payment, credentials) is encrypted at rest using AES-256 or equivalent industry standards.\n- **Service Segmentation:** Use of microservices ensures isolation between checkout, user management, and analytics. Least privilege is applied for communications.\n- **Network Security:** Separation of public/private subnets, strict firewall rules, DDoS protection, and regular external/internal security scans.\n- **API Security:** Strict input validation, rate limiting, and anti-CSRF/XSS/SQL injection shields.\n- **Incident Response:** Defined process for security breach notification, automated security monitoring, and rapid response mechanisms with a post-mortem process.\n\n## 2. Compliance Matrix\n| Standard/Regulation     | Relevant Modules                | Key Requirements & Approach                                                               |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| GDPR                   | All data handling               | User consent management, right to access/erasure, data minimization, Data Processing Agreements |\n| PCI DSS                | Payments                        | Card data never stored post-authorization, network segmentation, regular audits, tokenization         |\n| e-Commerce Law (KR/US/EU) | Entire platform                | Electronic transactions certification, customer protections, returns, and dispute handling        |\n| Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)| Front-end                       | Perceivable, operable, understandable, robust content; ARIA roles and keyboard navigation         |\n\n## 3. Audit Logging and Privacy\n- **Comprehensive Audit Trails:** All critical actions (login, product changes, financial transactions, permission assignments) are logged with immutable logs, storing timestamps, actor, and action type.\n- **Anonymization & Retention:** Logs and analytics are pseudonymized; retention periods are transparently communicated and controlled in line with local laws.\n- **Privacy by Design:** Privacy impact assessments are performed for every release; default settings favor minimal data collection and sharing.\n- **User Controls:** Users can export, review, and request erasure of their personal data through dedicated UI flows.\n\n## 4. Accessible and Internationalized UI/UX\n- **Globalization:** Full multilingual UI (starting with English, Korean, and Japanese), locale-aware formatting for currency, numbers, and dates.\n- **Accessibility Features:** Follows WCAG 2.1 Level AA—semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, high-contrast options, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, alternative text for graphics.\n- **Continuous Testing:** Regular accessibility and localization reviews, with direct input from users and stakeholders.\n\n## 5. Acceptance Criteria\n- No unauthorized access is possible across tenant boundaries or privileged operations.\n- Platform passes independent penetration, compliance, and accessibility audits.\n- Documentation and audit logs available for all regulatory and data subject requests.\n- All new features undergo security, privacy, and accessibility reviews prior to release.\n\nIs there anything else to refine or expand in this document?"},"step":0,"created_at":"2025-07-24T18:58:33.672Z","completed_at":"2025-07-24T19:00:25.064Z"}]
