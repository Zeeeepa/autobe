This section provides an in-depth explanation of the foundational business concepts that underpin the AI Mall platform, with particular focus on the impact of AI integration on channels, sections, categories, and their relationships.\n\n## Key Business Concepts\n\n### 1. Channels\n- **Definition:** Channels represent primary sales and engagement avenues where products and sellers are exposed to customers. Examples include web storefronts, mobile apps, social commerce integrations, and even AI-powered conversational interfaces.\n- **AI Impact:** AI enables channel-specific personalization, automatic content adaptation for each channel, and real-time performance analytics, ensuring customers receive targeted offerings regardless of touchpoint.\n- **Channel-Specific Use Cases:**\n    - Personalized homepages per user per channel\n    - Omnichannel order/fulfillment synchronization\n    - Segmentation analytics by channel\n\n### 2. Sections\n- **Definition:** Sections subdivide the UI within channels to group content logically—examples include featured banners, product carousels, AI-generated recommendations (“You May Also Like”), and category showcases.\n- **AI Impact:** AI curates section content dynamically, learns from user behavior, and tests layouts to optimize engagement. A/B/n testing powered by AI identifies the most effective placements, while adaptive sections respond to inventory and demand in real time.\n- **Section Design Principles:**\n    - Flexibility for administrators and sellers\n    - Allow AI-driven automation or manual overrides\n    - Analytics dashboards for section performance\n\n### 3. Categories\n- **Definition:** Categories provide the classification backbone for the product catalog, enabling efficient browsing, filtering, and merchandising.\n- **AI Impact:**\n    - AI-driven taxonomy optimization: The system continuously refines categories based on evolving product data and user search/browse patterns.\n    - Automatic category suggestions and anomaly detection (e.g., miscategorized listings)\n- **Category Management:**\n    - Multiple hierarchical levels (e.g., Electronics > Wearables > Smartwatches)\n    - AI-assisted creation of emerging trend categories\n    - Integration with tagging systems\n\n### 4. Seller, Product, and Customer Relationships\n- **Seller Roles:**\n    - Owners of catalogs within specific channels or globally\n    - Use AI tools for pricing, inventory forecasting, and campaign optimization\n- **Product Definitions:**\n    - Rich metadata, automated enrichment (e.g., generating descriptions, attributes, SEO)\n    - Media support, including AI-enhanced images or 3D models\n- **Customer Profiles:**\n    - Unified across channels, featuring AI-recommended content, purchase histories, and loyalty behaviors\n    \n### 5. AI Integration and Transformation\n- **Adaptive Merchandising:**\n    - AI personalizes product sequences at every point of the journey (search, recommendations, promotions)\n    - Automation of cross-sell/upsell logic in both catalog and checkout flows\n- **Data-Driven Operations:**\n    - Real-time dashboards, anomaly/incident alerts\n    - Predictive demand modeling and smart inventory controls\n\n## Diagram: Entity Relationships & Concepts\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n    CHANNELS ||--|{ SECTIONS : contains\n    SECTIONS ||--|{ CATEGORIES : displays\n    CATEGORIES ||--|{ PRODUCTS : organizes\n    SELLERS ||--|{ PRODUCTS : lists\n    CUSTOMERS ||--|{ ORDERS : places\n    PRODUCTS ||--|{ ORDERS : included_in\n```\n\n## Cross-Document References\n- [User and Access Management](./03_ai-mall_user-and-access-management.md)\n- [Product Management](./04_ai-mall_product-management.md)\n- [AI Features and Analytics](./08_ai-mall_ai-features-and-analytics.md)\n\nIs there anything else to refine or expand in this business concepts document?",

      "04_ai-mall_product-management.md": "# AI Mall Product Management Specification\n\n## 1. Overview\nAI Mall's product management offers advanced catalog operations enhanced by AI automation and data-driven workflows. This document defines how customers, sellers, and administrators manage catalogs, products, options, variants, bundles, and snapshots, all within an extensible, automation-ready environment.\n\n## 2. Objectives\n- Enable seamless, error-free catalog management for sellers/admins\n- Drive conversion and revenue through AI-powered optimization of product data, bundles, and recommendations\n- Protect catalog integrity with robust versioning, audit trails, and rollback abilities\n\n## 3. User Roles & Access\n| Role          | Capabilities                                                          |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Customer      | View products, options, bundles, reviews                              |\n| Seller        | CRUD products/options/variants/bundles; view analytics; automate tasks |\n| Administrator | Full access; manage all products and catalogs; oversee audits          |\n\n## 4. Functional Requirements\n### 4.1 Product Lifecycle Management\n- **Create, Update, Delete, Archive Products**: Sellers and admins can CRUD product records via UI or RESTful API. Each action triggers a snapshot (see 4.4).\n- **Bulk Edits/Imports**: Supports CSV, Excel, and API-based bulk actions, with preview and validation.\n- **AI Suggestions**: The system suggests optimal titles, descriptions, tags, and imagery, optionally integrating with internal/external LLMs.\n    - Example: Upon creation, an AI-powered summary and SEO keyword set for a T-shirt product is auto-generated but can be manually overridden by the seller.\n- **Data Structure Example**:\n```json\n{\n  \"productId\": \"SKU-12345\",\n  \"name\": \"Eco Cotton T-Shirt\",\n  \"description\": \"Premium organic cotton T-shirt with customizable fit.\",\n  \"category\": \"Apparel\",\n  \"aiTitleSuggestions\": [\"100% Organic Cotton Tee\", \"Eco Comfort Shirt\"]\n}\n```\n\n### 4.2 Options & Variants\n- **Options**: Sellers define selectable attributes (color, size, material). Variants are auto-generated or managed via UI/API.\n- **Inventory/Price Sync**: Central inventory system ensures accurate stock across all combinations. Edge-case handling for option/variant deletion (e.g., reallocation or soft-delete of inventory).\n- **Recommendation Engine**: AI proposes which options to add/remove for maximizing sales based on trends, e.g., suggesting a new color based on regional demand.\n- **Variant Example**:\n```json\n{\n  \"variantId\": \"SKU-12345-RED-M\",\n  \"productId\": \"SKU-12345\",\n  \"options\": {\"color\": \"Red\", \"size\": \"M\"},\n  \"stock\": 120,\n  \"price\": 24.99\n}\n```\n\n### 4.3 Bundles & Linked Items\n- **Bundles**: Sellers/AI can group multiple products as purchasable sets. Linked items (upsell, cross-sell) are managed similarly.\n- **AI Bundle Creator**: Suggests bundles based on purchase history (e.g., \"Frequently Bought Together\").\n- **Error Handling**: If a constituent product is deleted or out of stock, bundle auto-updates or flags seller for action.\n- **Bundle Definition Example**:\n```json\n{\n  \"bundleId\": \"BNDL-987\",\n  \"products\": [\"SKU-12345\", \"SKU-55521\"],\n  \"discountType\": \"percentage\",\n  \"discountValue\": 10\n}\n```\n\n### 4.4 Catalog Snapshots & Audits\n- **Snapshot Creation**: Every material change creates a full, timestamped snapshot; kept for 2 years (configurable).\n- **Audit Logging**: Each edit stores before/after JSON, actor, role, and event type.\n- **Restoration Workflow**: Permitted users can restore any snapshot from the audit UI; admin approval may be required for high-risk reverts.\n- **Sample Audit Entry**:\n```json\n{\n  \"eventId\": \"AUD-0001\",\n  \"actor\": \"seller:admin_jane\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2025-07-14T18:00:00+09:00\",\n  \"action\": \"update_product\",\n  \"before\": {\"price\": 19.99},\n  \"after\": {\"price\": 17.99}\n}\n```\n\n### 4.5 Automation & AI Enhancements\n- **Automated Workflows**: Batch task automation includes scheduled price updates, inventory sync with third parties, and new product suggestions.\n- **AI Interaction**: Users may review and accept/reject AI recommendations (e.g., taxonomy reorganizations, AI-generated content/images).\n- **Fallback/Override**: All AI actions are transparent and either require explicit user consent or can be reverted via snapshot.\n- **Sample AI Taxonomy Suggestion API**:\n```json\n{\n  \"request\": \"Suggest improved product categories for product SKU-12345\",\n  \"response\": [\"Apparel > T-Shirts > Sustainable\"]\n}\n```\n\n## 5. Integration Points\n- User authentication/roles managed in [03_ai-mall_user-and-access-management.md]\n- System extensibility/architecture in [09_ai-mall_system-architecture-and-extensibility.md]\n- Attachment/media handling in [10_ai-mall_attachments-and-media.md]\n\n## 6.

      "09_ai-mall_system-architecture-and-extensibility.md": "# AI Mall System Architecture & Extensibility\n\n## Overview\nThis document provides a detailed look at the system architecture of the AI Mall platform, emphasizing scalability, multichannel support, modular sectioning, and extensibility. It outlines how the platform is structured to support diverse user roles, channel separation (web, mobile, API, admin), and smooth future growth via well-defined integration points.\n\n## 1. Architectural Principles\n- **Layered Design**: Clear separation among presentation, business logic, and data layers, facilitating maintainability.\n- **Modularization**: Functionality is divided into distinct modules such as user management, product catalog, orders, reviews, promotions, and analytics.\n- **Channel Agnosticism**: All core services are channel-neutral, supporting web, mobile, and third-party integrations via unified APIs.\n- **Extensibility First**: The system is designed to plug in new modules or extend features with minimal disruption.\n\n## 2. High-Level Diagram\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n  Portal[\"Multi-Channel Portal (Web/Mobile/API)\"]\n  Admin[\"Admin Console\"]\n  Gateway[\"API Gateway\"]\n  Core[\"Core Service Layer\"]\n  DB[\"Database & Media Storage\"]\n  AI[\"AI/Analytics Engine\"]\n\n  Portal-->Gateway\n  Admin-->Gateway\n  Gateway-->Core\n  Core-->DB\n  Core-->AI\n```\n\n## 3. Channel & Role Segregation\n- **Customer Interface**: Frontend built for customers; accesses platform features via RESTful/GraphQL APIs.\n- **Seller Portal**: Dedicated area for sellers with dashboard, analytics, and product/order management tools.\n- **Admin Console**: Restricted access for platform operations, user/seller management, auditing, and compliance, insulated from customer/seller traffic.\n- **API Channel**: Enables secure third-party integrations.\n\n## 4. Extensibility & Plug-in Support\n- **Microservice Modules**: Each business function (e.g., Inventory, Promotions) runs as a loosely coupled microservice.\n- **Plugin Architecture**: New modules, payment gateways, recommendation engines, or integrations can be added via defined plugin points and extension hooks.\n\n## 5. Scalability & Fault Tolerance\n- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless services deployable across multiple servers/instances for load balancing.\n- **Resilience**: Graceful failure handling, circuit breakers, and service isolation minimize system downtime.\n- **Caching Layers**: Integrated for high-traffic read operations (e.g., product listings).\n\n## 6. Customization & Future-Proofing\n- **Configurable Workflows**: Admins can tailor flows (approval, shipment, payments) per channel or seller.\n- **Localization & Accessibility**: Designed for easy language and locale expansion (refer to [12_ai-mall_localization-and-accessibility.md](./12_ai-mall_localization-and-accessibility.md)).\n- **API-First**: Ensures UI/UX changes require minimal backend modification.\n\n## 7. Integration & Data flows\n- **External Integrations**: Payment, shipping, analytics, and AI/ML services connect via standard APIs.\n- **Event Bus**: For cross-module communication, event-driven processing, and extensibility triggers.\n\n---\n\nFor further details on channel-specific architecture or extensibility guidelines, see:\n- [03_ai-mall_user-and-access-management.md](./03_ai-mall_user-and-access-management.md)\n- [08_ai-mall_ai-features-and-analytics.md](./08_ai-mall_ai-features-and-analytics.md)\n- [12_ai-mall_localization-and-accessibility.md](./12_ai-mall_localization-and-accessibility.md)\n\nIs there anything else to refine or clarify in this architectural overview?",
      "10_ai-mall_attachments-and-media.md": "# Attachments & Media Management\n\n## Overview\nThis document defines the system for managing attachments and media within AI Mall, including requirements for image, document, and multimedia upload/storage, access control, security, metadata, versioning, CDN distribution, accessibility, compliance, and error handling. The goal is to provide a robust, secure, and accessible media service for customers, sellers, and administrators.\n\n## Objectives\n- Ensure reliable upload, storage, retrieval, and deletion of media.\n- Support scalability via CDN and extendability for new media types.\n- Enforce strict access and security protocols for sensitive assets.\n- Support metadata tagging, versioning, accessibility, and regulatory compliance.\n\n## Supported Attachment Types & Constraints\n| Type        | Formats            | Max Size | Notes                                  |\n|-------------|--------------------|----------|----------------------------------------|\n| Images      | JPEG, PNG, WebP    | 10MB     | Requires alt text for accessibility    |\n| Documents   | PDF, DOCX          | 20MB     | Virus scan and preview support         |\n| Videos      | MP4, WebM          | 100MB    | Subtitles/captions mandatory           |\n| Audio       | MP3, WAV           | 20MB     | Transcripts recommended                |\n| Avatars     | JPEG, PNG, WebP    | 2MB      | Square crop enforced                   |\n\n## Roles & Permissions\n- **Customer:** Upload product inquiry images, review images/videos, download/view permitted media, manage own uploads.\n- **Seller:** Manage product and store images/media, access/download own attachments, moderate customer uploads on listings.\n- **Administrator:** Full access to all media, global moderation, forensic/audit capability, handle legal/compliance removals.\n\n## File Storage & Security\n- All files stored with TLS encryption in transit; at-rest encryption in storage.\n- Public/private ACL on per-file basis with secure URLs (limited TTL for private links).\n- Integration with virus/malware scanning and content moderation services.\n- Metadata (e.g., uploader, timestamps, media type, version, usage context) attached to every file.\n- Versioning maintained for all editable media.\n\n## Workflow: Product Image Upload & Error Handling\n1. **User initiates upload** via product listing form (seller role) or review/inquiry (customer role).\n2. **File validation** (size, type, virus scan, metadata completeness e.g., alt text).\n   - **Failure A:** Disallowed format/type → Error message; file rejected.\n   - **Failure B:** Size quota exceeded → Warning; file rejected; display current usage/quota.\n   - **Failure C:** Virus or unsafe content detected → Quarantine file; notify uploader and admin; log audit event.\n   - **Failure D:** Permission error → Block action; suggest proper login/role.\n3. **Metadata entry required,** e.g., alt text, category, linked product ID. System enforces required fields and input constraints.\n4. **Secure upload to server/storage** with pre-signed URL (if using external object storage/CDN).\n5. **Automatic post-upload audit** for compliance and accessibility (e.g., missing alt text, large file with no preview, inappropriate content flagging).\n6. **CDN distribution**: Public files instantly available through CDN; private files restricted via access tokens.\n7. **Completion response** with success, file URL, and metadata display. If any step fails, descriptive error and recovery path provided (retry, alternate format, or support contact).\n\n## Mermaid: File Upload Flow\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Select File on Page] --> B{Validation}\n    B -- Validates --> C[Upload to Storage]\n    B -- Fails: Type/Size/Scan --> F1[Display Error; Block Upload]\n    C --> D[Attach Metadata]\n    D --> E[Compliance/Accessibility Check]\n    E -- OK --> F[CDN Distribution]\n    E -- Blocked --> F2[Flag, Quarantine, Notify]\n    F & F2 --> G[Return Status/Link to User]\n```\n\n## Integration with Other Modules\n- **Product Management:** Product images and documents are referenced in product objects; updates/deletions reflected in product catalog in real-time. API endpoints (e.g., `/products/{id}/media`) accept file references and return presigned URLs or CDN links.\n- **Inquiry & Review:** Attachments media (typically images, smaller videos) linked to reviews and Q&A entities, with moderation events/info stored per attachment. External modules query attachments by type and context.\n- **User/Store Profiles:** Avatars and store banners managed by upload endpoints specific to user/store objects, enforcing size/crop rules; media URLs returned for UI use.\n- **Analytics:** Media usage statistics (views/downloads/errors) available to analytic modules via event logging and aggregate queries.\n- **Inter-service Communication:** Microservices reference attachments by UUID or slug, communicate over internal API for permission checks and fetches. All upload, access, and removal occur via authenticated endpoints with auditing enabled.\n\n## Accessibility & Compliance\n- **WCAG Compliance:** Alt-text for all images, subtitles/captions for video, transcripts for audio, text alternatives for media-dependent information.\n- **GDPR/Data Subject Rights:** Users can request deletion of their own uploads (implemented via request/approval workflow and physical file removal). PII in media (faces, personal docs) flagged for privacy compliance.\n- **Audit/Tracking:** All upload/download/deletion events tracked with user attribution and timestamps.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All file uploads must pass validation for size, type, and content safety; error cases (malformed file, permission denied, exceeding quotas, unsupported format, CDN propagation failure) must return user-friendly errors and log for audit.\n- Retry logic on upload and CDN publication errors with exponential backoff, tracked in logs. 99.5% successful upload rate within 2 seconds (SLA); retry up to three times before final failure.\n- Role-based access control strictly enforced at download and delete endpoints; unauthorized access or attempted leakage is blocked and audit logged.\n- Accessibility checks (alt text, captions, transcripts) required before finalizing any public media.\n- GDPR workflow: Users may trigger file erasure requests from their profile, tracked in a queue for admin approval; full erasure must complete within 30 days.\n- Media versioning allows rollback, audit history, and restoration by admins.\n\n**Test Scenarios:**\n- Upload a valid product image: success, URL returned, preview visible.\n- Upload a corrupt/virus-infected file: blocked, audit record created.\n- Attempt to download a private file as unauthorized user: permission denied, error logged.\n- Accessibility audit: submit image without alt text → show validation error.\n- Erasure request: user requests file removal, item enters admin approval queue.\n\n## Error/Exception Handling\n- **Virus Scan Failure:** Quarantine and notify both uploader and admin. Prevent access until cleared or deleted.\n- **Unauthorized Access:** Deny operation, inform user with guidance for access/role changes.\n- **Quota Exceeded:** Inform user of limits, offer compression/suggestions.\n- **Corrupt File:** Reject on upload, suggest retry or file conversion.\n- **CDN Propagation Lag:** Allow retries; notify on extended delay. Log delays for review.\n\n---\n[Back to TOC](./00_ai-mall_toc.md)\n",
