Data Integrity & Preservation\n- **Transaction Consistency:** All data writes are ACID-compliant; rollback on failure.\n- **Evidence Preservation:**\n    - All system actions, model decisions, and automated events must be time-stamped and non-repudiable.\n    - Long-term archival of key datasets, AI model versions, and decision logs to support forensic analysis and compliance investigations.\n\n## 5. Compliance: Regulatory, Privacy & Accessibility\n- **Privacy Regulations:** GDPR, CCPA, and local market equivalents—right to be forgotten, explicit consent for profiling, data subject access requests (DSARs).\n- **Audit-Ready Structure:**\n    - Automated compliance status reports with drilldown on AI-driven actions.\n    - Configurable data retention, export, and purge policies (by entity and geography).\n- **Accessibility:** Support for assistive technologies; WCAG 2.1 AA for all administrable backends and user data queries.\n- **Multicultural & Multilingual:**\n    - Unicode-standard data representation;\n    - Localization-ready logs, permission names, regulatory responses.\n\n## 6. AI-Native Security Considerations\n- **Model Governance:**\n    - Model registration, lineage tracking, and automated testing for drift and bias.\n    - Explainability requirements: All AI-driven outcomes must be queryable with rationale explanations (for recommendations, pricing, moderation).\n- **Continuous ML Security:**\n    - Encrypted in-transit and at-rest for all AI operational data.\n    - Model input/output validation and adversarial attack detection.\n\n## 7.
