      "09_ai_ecommerce_personalization_favorites.md": "# AI E-commerce Platform: Personalization & Favorites\n\n## Overview\nThis document outlines the business requirements, features, and functional flows for personalization modules within the AI-powered e-commerce platform. Its focus is on user-centric features like favorites, recommendations, tagging, and snapshotting, which deliver individualized shopping experiences and improved engagement.\n\n## Objectives\n- Enhance customer retention and satisfaction via tailored product experiences\n- Increase discoverability of relevant products\n- Support customer-centric workflows (favorites, recent views, tagging)\n- Provide data-driven recommendations using AI\n- Enable snapshotting of user states and preferences for consistent cross-device experiences\n\n## User Personas\n| Persona        | Description                                                                                     |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Customer      | Browses/shop, maintains favorites, uses tags, receives suggestions, expects high personalization |\n| Seller        | Monitors analytics on product favoriting & recommendation, adjusts offerings accordingly         |\n| Administrator | Oversees algorithms, manages compliance, analyzes personalization effectiveness                  |\n\n## Functional Requirements\n### Favorites System\n- Customers can add/remove products to personal favorites list\n- Favorites synchronized across web/mobile platforms\n- Limits and batch management supported (e.g., up to 500 items)\n- Favorites grouped by tags or categories (user-defined tagging)\n\n### Personalized Recommendations\n- System generates recommendations based on user behavior (favorites, views, orders)\n- AI models to factor recency, frequency, category affinity, and contextual triggers (e.g., seasonal, trending)\n- Expose APIs for real-time recommendations alongside curated sets\n\n### Tagging & Organization\n- Allow users to tag favorite products with custom labels (e.g., \"Gift ideas\")\n- Tag-based filtering for personalized organization and quick retrieval\n\n### Snapshotting & Portability\n- User preferences and favorite lists are snapshot and restorable upon login from any device\n- Enable export/import of preferences for data portability (compliance-ready)\n\n### Seller/Administrator Tools\n- Seller dashboard visualizes favorites/engagement statistics at product/category level\n- Admin management panel configures AI model parameters, A/B testing, compliance flags\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- High-availability and responsive user interactions (SLA: <2s for list loading)\n- Robust data protections, privacy, and compliance with data export/erase requests\n- Secure API authentication scoped per customer role\n\n## User Journey Example\n```\n1. Customer logs in.\n2. Reviews product and marks as favorite. Optionally tags (e.g., \"Wishlist\").\n3. System updates favorite list in real time.\n4. Customer receives dynamic recommendations on homepage and categories.\n5. Later, customer logs in via mobile, sees identical favorites and recommendations.\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Product can be added/removed to favorites and tagged; changes are instantly reflected\n- Personalized recommendations reflect recent behaviors and update periodically\n- Users can snapshot, restore, and export their preference data\n- Sellers & admins access engagement analytics and configuration options\n\n## Future Expansion\n- Cross-platform favorite syncing for external e-commerce partners\n- Deeper AI explainability features for recommendations\n",
      "10_ai_ecommerce_architecture_compliance_future.md": "# AI E-Commerce Platform: Architecture, Compliance & Future-Proofing\n\n---\n\n## 1. Overview\nThis document outlines the architectural foundation, extensibility approach, compliance frameworks, and forward-looking strategies of the AI-powered e-commerce platform. It defines key principles ensuring scalability, regulatory alignment, security, integration agility, and sustained competitive advantage.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Solution Architecture Principles\n- **API-First Design:** All core services and business logic are exposed via standardized RESTful/docs-enabled APIs, enabling omnichannel integration, partner on-boarding, and headless commerce models.\n- **Modular Microservices:** Functional domains (user, product, order, payment, personalization, analytics) are implemented as loosely coupled, independently deployable microservices. Strong service boundary adherence facilitates scaling and maintenance.\n- **Event-Driven Orchestration:** Domain events (e.g., order_created, payment_captured, review_posted) flow through an event bus, supporting eventual consistency, extensibility, and real-time analytics/automation.\n- **Security & Privacy by Design:** Data minimization, encrypted storage in transit/at rest, principle of least privilege, and secure API gateway enforcement protect customer and business interests.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Extensibility & Integration Strategy\n- **Dynamic Service Registry & Discovery:** Enables seamless integration with future AI modules, external marketplaces (B2B/B2C), and payment/loyalty partners.\n- **Plug-in Framework:** Allows custom business rules, AI model selection, and vertical-specific features via well-defined plugin contracts.\n- **Open API Documentation:** Interactive documentation supports third-party development, mobile app enablement, and self-service onboarding.\n- **Versioning & Backward Compatibility:** Stable API version management ensures ecosystem resilience and accommodates iterative evolution.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Compliance & Operational Safeguards\n- **Data/Commerce Governance:** Compliant with GDPR, CCPA, KISA (Korea), PCI DSS, and e-commerce-specific regulations. PII masking, consent management, and audit trails are mandatory.\n- **Financial Integrity:** Transaction logs, refund/reverse flows, and AI decisions are traceable and available for regulatory review.\n- **Accessibility (A11y):** Conforms to WCAG 2.1 AA; programmatic access for assistive technologies is guaranteed at all public touchpoints.\n\n---\n\n## 5. AI-Readiness & Optimization\n- **Data Layer:** Unified customer, product, and behavioral data models enable future AI/ML scenario expansion (e.g., real-time recommendations, dynamic pricing, fraud detection).\n- **Model Management:** Supports integration with model registries and on-demand model upgrades; AI/ML inference is observable and explainable.\n- **Ops Automation:** Auto-scaling, canary deployment, and incident tracking are automated for reliability and rapid iteration.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Future-Proofing & Key Business Rules\n- **Composable Business Logic:** Rule engine and workflow orchestration allow business teams to adapt policies without code redeployment.\n- **Multi-Region & Localization:** Architecture supports multiple languages, currencies, tax regimes, and localized content (SEO, legal, product info).\n- **Auditability & Analytics:** All high-value interactions and data changes are logged, aggregated, and surfaced via analytics APIs for continuous business improvement.\n\n---\n\n## 7.
