Objectives\n- Increase customer engagement and retention with flexible promotion tools\n- Empower sellers with tailored campaigns while preserving platform integrity\n- Enable robust audit and monitoring for regulatory and operational compliance\n\n## 3. Key Entities (Contextual Introduction)\n- **Coupon:** Digital voucher applicable to eligible orders, unique or universal, tracked individually.\n- **DiscountCampaign:** Campaign aggregating rules, periods, scope (product, seller, category).\n- **LoyaltyTransaction:** Records user points accrual/redemption, with metadata for tracking and auditing.\n- **AbuseIncident:** Flagged events, system-generated or admin-marked, for suspicious promotional activity.\n\n## 4. Discount & Coupon Management\n### Types and Rules\n- Order-level discounts, Product-level discounts, User-targeted coupons (single/multi-use), Stacking/combination logic.\n\n#### Core EARS Requirements\n- THE discount subsystem SHALL apply the highest priority eligible discount to an order.\n- WHEN a user applies a coupon code, THE system SHALL validate eligibility (user, date, product, campaign limits) before deduction.\n- IF multiple stackable discounts are present, THEN THE system SHALL apply combination logic as defined by campaign stacking rules.\n- WHEN conflicting campaign rules are encountered, THE system SHALL enforce precedence using explicit priority values defined in each DiscountCampaign.\n- WHEN a coupon is redeemed, THE system SHALL record the Coupon entity status as used and update campaign usage counts.\n- WHEN per-user campaign limits are exhausted, THE system SHALL deny further coupon applications and provide user feedback.\n\n#### Edge Cases & Examples\n- Example: If a user has both a single-use and a multi-use coupon for the same product, the system applies the single-use coupon if it offers a greater discount, marks it as used in the Coupon entity, and records a LoyaltyTransaction for tracking.\n- Example: If campaign stacking allows product and order discounts, and the user applies both, the system computes each effect sequentially, records all relevant entities (Coupon, DiscountCampaign), and rejects further coupons if the stack limit is reached.\n- IF a coupon is attempted after the campaign expiry date, THEN THE system SHALL block redemption and log the AbuseIncident if the pattern exceeds the fraud threshold.\n\n## 5. Loyalty (Deposit/Mileage) Logic\n### Accrual and Redemption\n- Points (mileage, deposit) are earned via orders, special activities, campaign participation, and onboarding/referral events.\n- THE loyalty subsystem SHALL grant points upon payment completion (event-driven), as clearly recorded via LoyaltyTransaction.\n- WHEN users attempt redemption, THE system SHALL check available point balance, campaign/topic eligibility, and point expiry before approval.\n\n#### Expiration, Invalidation, and Abuse Prevention\n- WHEN points are unredeemed by the expiration date, THE system SHALL automatically expire them, update LoyaltyTransaction, and notify the user.\n- IF abnormal accrual patterns (e.g., repeated self-referrals, rapid high-value earnings) are detected, THEN THE system SHALL freeze suspect accounts, log an AbuseIncident, and trigger administrator review.\n- WHEN a refund is processed, THE system SHALL reverse points proportionally.\n\n#### Edge-Case Example\n- Example: A user accumulates referral bonuses using multiple fake accounts; the AI-driven monitor triggers a freeze in loyalty redemptions, generates an AbuseIncident record, and prompts admin notification for investigation.\n\n## 6. Campaign Analytics & AI-Driven Abuse Monitoring\n### Metrics & Detection\n- Metrics: redemption rates, issuance-to-redemption time, per-campaign fraud events, stacking ratio, redemption velocity, user segment success rates.\n- WHEN anomalies in redemption velocity or campaign concentration are detected (e.g., 10x typical rate within an hour), THE system SHALL flag these for review.\n- The platform SHALL provide dashboards for tracking campaign efficiency, fraud trends, and user participation.\n\n#### EARS Example\n- WHEN AI detects coupon stacking outliers (e.g., unusually frequent combined usage by one segment), THE system SHALL generate an AbuseIncident with full incident context for administrator action.\n- WHEN a new campaign is launched, THE analytics system SHALL baseline usage patterns within the first 48 hours to establish fraud and success benchmarks.\n\n## 7. Non-Functional Requirements\n- THE system SHALL audit all DiscountCampaign, Coupon, and LoyaltyTransaction events for compliance using immutable logs.\n- THE system SHALL support concurrent access for 10,000+ simultaneous discount/coupon validation requests without degradation.\n- IF data integrity is compromised (e.g., coupon applied more than once), THEN THE system SHALL provide a rollback using entity versioning.\n- THE system SHALL enforce role-based security for discount/loyalty management (admin, seller, customer segmentation).\n- WHEN a critical system failure is detected, THEN THE system SHALL switch to fail-safe mode, disabling all new campaign redemptions.\n\n## 8. Acceptance Criteria\n- All business rules for discounts/coupons/loyalty written above SHALL be verifiable by unit/functional tests referencing the relevant EARS statements above.\n- THE system SHALL provide transparent audit trails for every entity referenced.\n- WHEN a user is denied a discount/coupon/point due to campaign or eligibility rules, THEN clear error messages SHALL be delivered, with complete rationale based on relevant entity data.\n- All AbuseIncidents SHALL be actionable by administrators within one business day of creation.\n\n## 9. ERD Reference\nSee [10_aimall-backend_technical-architecture-and-compliance.md](./10_aimall-backend_technical-architecture-and-compliance.md) for full ERD, including: Coupon, DiscountCampaign, LoyaltyTransaction, AbuseIncident entities as referenced above.\n","10_aimall-backend_technical-architecture-and-compliance.md":"# Technical Architecture and Compliance\n\n## 1. System Architecture\n\n### Modular Microservices\nThe platform shall employ a modular microservices architecture, with each microservice responsible for a well-defined domain boundary:\n- **User Service**: Manages registration, authentication, and user profiles. THE user service SHALL ensure user state consistency across sessions. IF user data update fails, THEN THE user service SHALL perform rollback and alert the admin.\n- **Product Service**: Handles CRUD operations for products, including inventory and pricing. WHEN a seller modifies product details, THE product service SHALL validate data against business rules.\n- **Order Service**: Facilitates cart checkout, order placement, and payment integration. WHEN order placement succeeds, THE order service SHALL trigger delivery scheduling via API.\n- **Community Service**: Manages bulletin boards, reviews, and user-to-user interaction.\n- **Analytics Service**: Aggregates logs, user behavior events, and performance metrics.\nServices interact via secured REST/gRPC APIs orchestrated by the API Gateway. Each service SHALL isolate its datastore, and communicates via event queues for eventual consistency.\n\n### API Gateway Pattern\nTHE API Gateway SHALL centralize external and internal API calls. THE system SHALL route incoming requests based on role (guest, member, seller, admin), applying JWT-based authentication and RBAC for endpoints. WHEN a request fails authentication, THE gateway SHALL return HTTP 401 and log ACCESS_DENIED. IF a seller submits an out-of-scope operation, THEN THE gateway SHALL reject the call with HTTP 403.\nFailed downstream requests SHALL return descriptive error messages for observability. THE gateway SHALL implement circuit breaker logic for repeated failures, and SHALL degrade gracefully to ensure partial functionality for most users.\n\n### High Availability\nTHE platform architecture SHALL enforce statelessness for horizontal scaling. Services SHALL be deployed across multiple availability zones and regions. WHEN instance health check fails, THE orchestrator SHALL trigger automatic replacement. IF regional failure is detected, THEN THE load balancer SHALL fail over to healthy regions, ensuring zero-downtime for critical operations. Scaling policies SHALL be driven by threshold metrics (e.g., CPU > 70% triggers scale-out). State synchronization (e.g., in-flight carts or sessions) SHALL utilize distributed cache with fallback persistence.\n\n### Data Security and Isolation\nTHE system SHALL implement logical multi-tenancy: all user, seller, and admin data SHALL be partitioned and scope-enforced at the datastore and API layers. WHERE sensitive personal data exists, THE system SHALL apply AES-256 encryption-at-rest and TLS-in-transit. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted, THE system SHALL deny with error, log activity, and notify the security officer. Exception handling SHALL employ rule-based masking for sensitive fields in logs.\n\n## 2. Regulatory / Compliance Design\n\n### Data Privacy (GDPR, CCPA, PIPA)\nTHE system SHALL provide workflows for data subject requests: WHEN a user requests data access, correction, or deletion, THE system SHALL process the request within legal timeframes, log actions, and confirm with the user. Consent capture SHALL be explicit at account creation. Data flow diagrams SHALL document where data is stored, processed, and transferred across regions. THE system SHALL pseudonymize or anonymize exported datasets for analytics. IF a user withdraws consent, THEN THE system SHALL revoke all non-essential data processing.\n\n### Audit Logging & Consent Management\nTHE platform SHALL retain audit logs for a minimum of 5 years. WHERE PII is present, logs SHALL be encrypted and, after the retention period, automatically anonymized or deleted. Audit logs SHALL record all admin actions, data changes, and user consent events. WHEN a data breach is detected, THE system SHALL flag affected entries, alert administrators, and support notification workflows per law.\n\n### Security Certifications\nTHE system SHALL be continuously monitored to enforce compliance checkpoints: security training for admins, secure SDLC processes, and annual penetration testing SHALL be documented. Logs from audits and certifications SHALL be stored in an immutable format. WHEN a compliance audit is due, THE compliance module SHALL export required documentation and evidence of controls to auditors.\n\n## 3. AI/ML Integration\n\n### AI Personalization & Insights\nTHE AI modules SHALL use per-user purchase history and behavioral data to deliver recommendations. THE model inference service SHALL log all recommendation events, providing an audit trail. WHERE Explainable AI (XAI) is enabled, THE system SHALL offer feature attribution details (e.g., “Recommended due to previous search for ‘smartphones’”). Admins SHALL be able to review AI-driven decisions for fairness, and rollback or retrain models as needed.\n\n### Data Governance\nTHE data governance system SHALL track all dataset versions and transformations using lineage records. WHERE data anomalies are detected, THE system SHALL auto-flag, trigger approval flows, and allow rollback to previous data snapshots.\n\n## 4. Analytics & Monitoring\n\nTHE analytics module SHALL consolidate platform KPIs (DAU, order conversion, churn rate) on real-time dashboards. WHEN critical error rates exceed threshold, THE system SHALL trigger alerts to on-call engineers. Sample incident: IF payment failure rate > 2% in 5 mins, THEN THE system SHALL escalate to L2 support and annotate incident timeline. Event logs SHALL be queryable for root-cause analysis. All system metrics SHALL be exportable in standard formats for BI tools.\n\n## 5. Extensibility & Future-Proofing\n\nTHE platform SHALL adopt versioned APIs and modular plugin architecture. WHEN a new feature is onboarded, THE core SHALL expose feature toggles and interface versioning to prevent breaking changes. WHERE backward compatibility is broken, THE gateway SHALL route legacy clients to fallback modules. The extension framework SHALL allow dynamic onboarding of new AI/ML modules, payment providers, or analytics dashboards without downtime.\n"},"step":0,"created_at":"2025-07-29T15:43:20.649Z","completed_at":"2025-07-29T15:45:00.368Z"}]
