Its layered approach, combined with clear separation of concerns, provides robust foundations essential for agile business evolution in e-commerce.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Architectural Principles\n- **Layered Architecture:** Decouples API, business logic, and data persistence/storage layers for maintainability.\n- **API Gateway:** Single entry point for channel-specific and shared APIs; supports REST and GraphQL for client flexibility.\n- **Service-Oriented Modules:** Core subsystems (User, Product, Order, Review, Personalization, etc.) are modularized for independent scalability.\n- **Statelessness:** Services designed for horizontal scaling with minimal coupling and state managed centrally (e.g., distributed cache/db).\n- **Multi-Tenant Support:** Logical tenant isolation at both the data and API layers to serve multiple brands, sellers, and partners.\n- **Observability:** Centralized logging and monitoring for all channel interactions and internal service communications.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core Extensibility Mechanisms\n- **Plug-in Service Architecture:** Each core business feature (e.g., loyalty, reviews, personalization, channel-specific UIs) can be added or upgraded without reworking the platform core.\n- **Channel/Section Management:**\n  - Channels (web, mobile, 3rd-party integrations) register via config or service discovery.\n  - Dynamic section/component loading and routing for content, offers, categories, etc.\n- **Content & Media Storage:**\n  - Abstracted file/media storage (S3, GCS, etc.): enables consistent access, CDN integration, and flexible media workflows.\n  - Metadata-driven referencing for banners, product images, AI-generated content.\n- **Scalable API Layer:**\n  - API versioning and route-mapping allow backward-compatible extensions.\n  - Automated channel/role-based authentication and authorization integration.\n- **Event & Message Bus:**\n  - All core domain events (order placed, stock updated, review posted, etc.) are propagated via message bus for decoupled triggers, inter-service workflows, and seamless new feature integration.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Onboarding New Channels & Services\n- **Channel Registration Flow:**\n  1. Admin configures new channel/brand profile using API or UI.\n  2. Channel-specific settings, UIs, and workflows are defined using templates.\n  3. Integration keys/secrets generated for secure access.\n  4. Channel routes/content are exposed via the unified API Gateway.\n- **Dynamic Feature Toggle:** New features and experimental modules can be deployed gradually to selected channels/segments without redeploying core system.\n- **Role & Policy Management:** Every new channel/service is mapped against role definitions (see [roles](./01_ai-mall-backend_roles.md)) for tailored permissions, data access, and user interfaces.\n- **Extending Data Models:** Polymorphic data stores (e.g., dynamic fields, document-db) and data dictionary management enable custom attributes per channel/service without schema rewrites.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Scalability & Future-Proofing\n- **Horizontal Scaling:** All stateless services can be auto-scaled; stateful resources utilize managed scaling and partitioning (e.g., sharded databases, distributed cache).\n- **Service Discovery & Health Checks:** Ensures resilient routing and high availability for all integrations.\n- **Modular Upgrade Path:** New functionality can be introduced in isolation and promoted to stable channels after validation; rollback is supported for faulty channel/service rollouts.\n- **API Extensibility:** API schemas are structured for easy extension; future AI-powered endpoints, 3rd-party integrations, and custom verticals can be onboarded with minimal friction.\n\n---\n\n## References\n- [Roles & Permissions](./01_ai-mall-backend_roles.md)\n- [User Management](./02_ai-mall-backend_user-management.md)\n- [Business Rules & Security](./09_ai-mall-backend_business-rules-security.md)\n- [Compliance & Accessibility](./10_ai-mall-backend_compliance-accessibility.md)\n","09_ai-mall-backend_business-rules-security.md":"# AI Mall Backend: Business Rules & Security\n\n## Overview\nThis document defines the comprehensive business logic, security policies, automation rules, permission models, and data integrity protocols for the AI Mall Backend. It is completely self-contained and details every critical element affecting the operation and protection of the system, including how these intersect with both AI-driven automation and manual processes.\n\n## Core Business Rules\n- **Unique Identity Enforcement:** Every user (customer, seller, admin, AI agent) must have a unique system-issued identifier. This ID is required for all transactions, data operations, and system events.\n- **Order Lifecycle Management:** Orders transition through well-defined states (e.g., Pending, Confirmed, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled). State changes trigger system-side logs and, where appropriate, notifications.\n- **Inventory Safeguards:** Product quantities are atomically checked and updated on placement/modification/cancellation of orders, preventing overselling and race conditions.\n- **Pricing & Promotion Rules:** All discounts, coupons, and promotional benefits are calculated server-side, validated for eligibility, and logged for auditing.\n- **User Content Moderation:** Automated AI modules monitor user-generated content (e.g., reviews, inquiries) for compliance and sentiment, flagging violations for manual review when necessary.\n\n## Automation & AI Integration\n- **Recommendation AI:** Product recommendations are dynamically generated using anonymized user data and behavioral analytics. All AI models are routinely retrained and validated for fairness and bias reduction.\n- **Sentiment & Fraud Detection:** Automated sentiment analysis is used to monitor reviews, while AI agents may flag transactions or users exhibiting abnormal or suspicious patterns.\n- **Escalation Workflows:** AI-detected issues (e.g., negative sentiment, suspected fraud) are logged as incidents and escalated to relevant managers or admins for human adjudication. Actions taken are recorded for compliance.\n\n## Security Model\n- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The system enforces strict scope-based permissions by user role (customer, seller, admin, AI agent). Each role only has access to the minimum data and functions required.\n- **Authentication & Session Management:** All APIs require secure authentication using tokens. Sessions are time-limited, with inactivity and forced expiration policies in place.\n- **API Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention:** All endpoints have rate limiting, anomaly detection, and automated blocking of abusive or suspicious behavior.\n- **Audit Logging:** All critical actions, including data modification, administrative access, and AI-driven interventions, are non-repudiably logged with timestamps, user/agent ID, and action metadata.\n- **Sensitive Data Handling:** Personally Identifiable Information (PII), payment credentials, and authentication tokens are encrypted in-transit and at-rest. Access to sensitive data is strictly restricted and monitored.\n- **Third-Party Integrations:** All external API calls (e.g., payment, shipping) are validated, signed, and monitored for anomalies.\n\n## Data Integrity & Evidence Protocols\n- **Immutable Audit Trail:** All business-critical changes (order creation, payment, product updates, admin changes) are recorded in tamper-evident logs.\n- **Integrity Verification:** Data checksums or hashes are used to detect tampering, validated on critical access or export.\n- **Incident Documentation:** Security or compliance incidents automatically generate evidence packets, containing event sequences, actor information, and system state snapshots.\n- **Role Delegation & Revocation:** Permissions delegation and revocation actions are immediately reflected in access logs and require secondary verification for high-privilege operations.\n\n## Compliance & Accessibility\n- **Privacy by Design:** Privacy principles are embedded throughout, including user consent management, right-to-be-forgotten workflows, and minimum necessary data exposure.\n- **Accessibility Support:** All user-facing interactions in the backend adhere to accessibility standards, generating responses compatible with assistive technologies and supporting alternative input/output formats where appropriate.\n- **Policy Updates:** Periodic reviews ensure that all business rules and security procedures comply with current regulatory requirements.\n\n## Enforcement & Exception Handling\n- **Automated Enforcement:** Violations of business rules or security policy automatically trigger system responses (e.g., access revocation, content removal, alerting).\n- **Manual Override:** Admins can perform overrides in justified cases; such actions are always logged and reviewed.\n- **Continuous Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring and alerting systems detect and respond to business and security rule violations, including potential AI model drift or abuse.\n","10_ai-mall-backend_compliance-accessibility.md":"# AI Mall Backend: Compliance, Accessibility, and Legal Requirements\n\n## Overview\nThis document outlines the comprehensive compliance, legal, accessibility, and internationalization requirements for the AI Mall backend system.
