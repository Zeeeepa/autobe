Leveraging AI algorithms, the system not only hosts traditional favorites operations (add/remove/view) but also intelligently surfaces, organizes, and recommends items based on evolving user preferences and contextual behaviors. This is a cross-module capability, accessible from product listings, detail views, user dashboards, and notification streams, making it a cornerstone for consistent user engagement and retention across device types and roles.\n\n## Objectives\n- Enable one-click addition and removal of favorites for products, inquiries, addresses, and notifications.\n- Provide AI-driven personalized favorites sorting and suggestions based on behavior history, stated interests, and contextual signals (e.g., season, promotions, stock changes).\n- Maintain robustness and clarity across exception cases (e.g., duplicate addition, deleted items, privacy restrictions).\n- Support advanced features such as batch-operations, favoriting limits, and smart folders.\n- Ensure full auditability and compliance with data privacy laws.\n\n## User Personas\n**Customer Persona**: \"Anna, the Variety Shopper\"\n- Anna is an active shopper who loves to explore trending and seasonal products. She frequently bookmarks items to compare, reorder, or watch for future discounts. For Anna, AI-organized favorites prioritize items with upcoming sales, those recently viewed, or ones with low stock.\n- *Scenario*: Anna favorites three handbags, two of which go on sale. The system pushes these products to the top of her favorites, notifying her of discounts. If Anna removes a favorite due to price increase, the AI learns to deprioritize similar items.\n\n**Seller Persona**: \"Leo, the Inventory Optimizer\"\n- Leo, as a seller, uses favorites to monitor competitive products and buyer inquiries. He wants to favorite certain repeat questions for quick response and frequently-watched competitor listings.\n- *Scenario*: Leo bookmarks high-performing competitor sneakers. After a stockout, the system recommends similar sneakers and sends trends based on his favorites.\n\n**Admin Persona**: \"Mina, the Compliance Guardian\"\n- Admins track favorites engagement, monitor for abuse or fraud (e.g., bots mass-favoriting products), and ensure privacy-compliant management.\n- *Scenario*: Mina observes a spike in favorites for a suspicious product, triggers an audit, and the system provides behavioral logs and AI-detected anomalies.\n\n## User Journeys\n**Customer Journey:**\n1. Anna browses bags and clicks “Add to Favorites” on several items. The UI confirms addition; duplicates return an “Already in favorites” toast.\n2. Favorites are grouped (e.g., by type or sale status) and sorted using AI (recent activity, promotions, personalized ranking).\n3. If a favorite is discontinued, Anna receives an alert and the item is moved to an “Unavailable” section.\n4. Anna selects multiple favorites for bulk removal; edge case: attempting to remove items already deleted from catalog prompts a skip/removal notification.\n5. Preference updates, such as a newly set favorite category, dynamically alter future recommendations.\n\n**Seller/Admin Journey:**\n- Leo marks a set of buyer FAQs as favorites for quick access. If a question is merged/removed by admin, Leo is notified and the favorite is archived.\n- Mina launches a batch review of sudden favorite increases for a flagged item, with system tools exposing both raw logs and AI anomaly scores.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- A user can add, view, delete, and organize favorites by type and tag; maximums per category are enforced (e.g., 200 products, 20 addresses).\n- Bulk operations: users may batch-add or remove favorites (restricted by quota and rate-limits).\n- AI personalization determines order based on frequency of interaction, recency, inferred interest, and event triggers. For example, if a user repeatedly searches but never purchases, AI might boost that favorite's rank temporarily.\n- API endpoints must validate entity existence; attempting to favorite a missing or restricted item returns a clear error.\n- Favorites must persist across devices; edge case: concurrent device changes must resolve conflicts using latest timestamp.\n- Privacy: only item owners and authorized admins may see a user’s favorites. Sharing options are opt-in and revoke permissions in real-time.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Scalability**: Must handle spikes (10x normal traffic) during events without loss or delay, e.g. Black Friday sales.\n- **Fault Tolerance**: In event of API outage, local UI should show the last synced state with a warning.\n- **Auditability**: All changes to favorites must be logged with before/after states for compliance.\n- **Performance**: Retrieval or update actions should complete within 250ms under peak load; AI re-ranking should not block UI responsiveness.\n- **Security**: All favorite actions require authentication matching user roles; permissions must be strictly enforced.\n\n## High-Level System Flow\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n  A[User Initiates Favorite Action] --> B{Type: Product, Inquiry, etc};\n  B --> C[API Validates Auth & Item Availability];\n  C -->|Valid| D[Add to Favorites];\n  C -->|Invalid/Exception| E[Return Error Message];\n  D --> F[AI Updates Personalized Order];\n  F --> G[Show Updated Favorites];\n  E --> G;\n```\n### Detailed Breakdown and Error Handling:\n1. **User Action**: Initiates favorite/unfavorite from any entry point (card, detail, notification, inquiry thread).\n2. **API Validation**: Checks authentication, quotas, existence, duplication, and privacy settings.\n   - Exception: Favoriting an item that no longer exists triggers a user-facing error and logs an AI learning signal (e.g., update personalization to avoid such items).\n   - Edge Case: Winning a high-volume race between two devices, the system uses latest timestamp; conflicts trigger a reconciliation prompt to user.\n3. **AI Re-Ranking**: After successful add/remove, user’s history (clicks, time spent, seasonal events) is evaluated using a priority matrix and/or decision tree (see below).\n   - Example: Anna's bag receives a promo event signal; AI boosts it, but deprioritizes discontinued items.\n4. **User Notification**: Alerts on failed attempts, batch outcome summaries, and targeted suggestions (e.g., “5 of your favorite shoes are on sale!”)\n5. **Sync and Consistency**: All changes are propagated in near real-time to all logged-in devices; event queues handle peak loads.\n\n#### AI Personalization Logic Example\n- Inputs: Favorited items list, recent views/clicks, purchase history, seasonal context, interaction recency/frequency.\n- Flow (pseudo-code):\n```\nFor each favorite:\n  score = AI_weighted_sum(\n    click_recency,\n    number_of_interactions,\n    purchase_proximity,\n    event_flags (e.g., sale, stock warning),\n    user_profile_signals\n  )\nOrder favorites by descending score.\nBoost if favorite matches: [current promotion OR abandoned cart OR trending search]\nDemote if: [item discontinued OR user recently removed similar items]\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- 100% of favorites operations covered by automated tests: normal, boundary, and exception flows.\n- Edge Cases: Attempting to favorite restricted, non-existent, or removed items generates clear errors and logs events.\n- Personalization tested: At least 90% satisfaction score in post-release A/B testing for AI recommendation accuracy.\n- All user actions yield appropriate visual feedback in all supported languages.\n- Audit logs: Any admin investigation can reconstruct event chronology for regulatory review.\n\n## References\n- [Table of Contents](./00_ai_shop_toc.md)\n- [System Architecture & Compliance](./11_ai_shop_system_architecture_and_compliance.md)\n","11_ai_shop_system_architecture_and_compliance.md":"# AI Shop System Architecture and Compliance\n\n## 1. Overview\nThe AI Shop system is engineered for high scalability, reliability, and compliance within a fast-evolving e-commerce landscape. The architectural design ensures flexible management of channels, sections, and categories, enabling seamless extension and adaptation to business growth and regulatory changes. This document outlines the structural blueprint, compliance foundations, and operational principles for system success.\n\n## 2. Architecture Principles\n- **Modular Structure:** Services are decomposed into modules (user, product, order, bulletin, etc.) for maintainability and scalability.\n- **Channel/Section/Category Management:** Dynamic registration and management of marketplace views, supporting various shopfronts and thematic aggregations.\n- **API-Driven:** RESTful and secure APIs for all user, seller, and admin roles; enables seamless integration and platform expansion.\n- **Extensible File Handling:** Scalable file storage tailored for product assets, user uploads, and future AI-generated content (e.g., images, personalized recommendations).\n- **Cloud-Native & Elastic:** Designed for containerized deployment (e.g., Kubernetes), facilitating horizontal scaling and disaster recovery.\n\n## 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)\n- **Customer:** API authentication for product browsing, ordering, and profile management.\n- **Seller:** API authentication for dashboard, inventory, and order/process operations.\n- **Admin:** API authentication for system configuration, compliance review, multiseller & user management.\n- **Least Privilege:** Role boundaries are strictly enforced to minimize security risks.\n\n## 4. Compliance & Legal Considerations\n- **Data Residency & Privacy:** Meets GDPR (EU), CCPA (CA), and PIPA (KR) principles on user consent, export, and deletion.\n- **Audit Logs:** Immutable, time-stamped logs for user/admin/seller actions; critical for dispute resolution and regulatory audit.\n- **Product/Content Moderation:** Automated and manual workflows for compliance with ecommerce and advertising law.\n- **Payment Compliance:** Adherence to PCI DSS for secure payment processing and sensitive data protection.\n\n## 5. Performance & Fault Tolerance\n- **Caching:** Aggressive caching for product catalogs, recommendations, and frequent API queries.\n- **Availability:** Multi-zone/cloud redundancy to ensure 24/7 operation and minimize downtime.\n- **Monitoring:** Real-time system and business metric dashboards, with automated alerting for SLA breaches or legal violations.\n\n## 6. Futureproofing & AI Readiness\n- **AI Evolution:** Modular slots for integrating future AI features (personalized search, chatbots, fraud detection).\n- **Extensibility:** Clear upgrade paths for new channels, product types, rules, and AI-driven automation.\n- **Change Management:** All alterations to system logic are versioned, validated in staging, and documented for traceability.\n\n## 7.
