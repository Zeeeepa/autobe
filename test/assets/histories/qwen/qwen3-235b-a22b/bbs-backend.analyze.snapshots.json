Discussion Board 01: Business Requirements\n\n## Overview\nThe Discussion Board application requires structured business requirements to ensure user engagement, content quality, and system efficiency.\n\n## Objectives\n1. Define explicit rules for user interactions\n2. Ensure content moderation maintains community standards\n3. Establish success metrics for system performance\n\n## User Personas\n| Role | Requirements |\n|-------|--------------|\n| Users | Create threads, post comments, up/downvote content\n| Moderators | Manage flagged content, warn users, impose restrictions\n| Admins | Adjust system configuration, monitor analytics, ban users\n\n## Functional Requirements (EARS Format)\n1. **Ubiquitous**: `The system shall persist all content with automated database backups occurring daily at midnight`\n2. **Event-driven**: `When a moderated user reaches 3 accumulated warning points, the system shall temporally restrict thread creation for 48 hours`\n3. **State-driven**: `While content remains flagged with ≥5 reports, the system shall display moderation alert across all interface views`\n4. **Unwanted Behavior**: `If content contains >2 offensive language trigger words, then the system shall automatically obscure text pending moderator review`\n5. **Optional Feature**: `Where premium subscription status exists, the system shall add sticky comment placement functionality for approved posts`\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- Performance: 95% of page loads complete in <2 seconds under 100 concurrent users\n- Security: Implement OWASP Top 10 protections against injection, XSS, CSRF attacks\n- Scalability: Support 1 million monthly active users with <1% error rate\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n| Requirement | Success Condition |\n|-------------|-------------------|\n| Thread Creation | 100% successful post persistence with error tracking |\n| Moderation | 24/7 availability of flagged content review panel |\n| Voting System | Maintain ±0.01% accuracy in community score calculation |\n\n[Next: User Journey

adds comment, THE system SHALL validate content rules\n   WHEN user upvotes/downvotes, THE system SHALL record vote\n4. **Content Moderation\n   IF inappropriate flag is raised, THEN moderation workflow SHALL initiate\n\n### Moderator Journey\n1. **Review Portal\n   WHILE in moderation mode, THE system SHALL display\n   - Flagged content queue\n   - Content history\n2. **Action Implementation\n   WHEN moderator removes content, THE system SHALL\n   - Log removal reason\n   - Notify original poster\n3. **User Management\n   IF repeated violations occur, THEN THE system SHALL enable user suspension\n\n### Admin Journey\n1. **System Configuration\n   WHEN admin updates settings, THE system SHALL validate input\n2. **Dashboard\n   THE system SHALL display analytics dashboard\n   - Content volume metrics\n   - User activity logs\n3. **Emergency Controls\n   WHEN admin initiates lock-down mode, THE system SHALL restrict posting\n\n## Access Control Matrix\n\n|

Discussion Board Business Requirements\n\n## Vision\nTo create a moderated, community-driven discussion platform where users can securely share ideas while maintaining content quality through structured moderation workflows.\n\n## Objectives\n1. Facilitate meaningful user interactions through threaded discussions\n2. Enable role-based content management (user, moderator, admin roles)\n3. Implement automated content quality control systems\n4. Store and analyze user interaction data for system improvement\n\n## User Personas (Detailed)\n**Basic User**\n- Primary goal: Participate in discussions without moderation responsibilities\n- Requirements:\n  - REGISTER account with email verification (WHEN registration form submitted, system SHALL send verification link)\n  - CREATE discussion threads with rich media (WHERE media included, system SHALL validate format and size)\n  - COMMENT with @mention functionality (WHILE typing, system SHALL suggest valid user names)\n\n**Moderator**\n- Primary goal: Maintain content quality within specific categories\n- Requirements:\n  - FLAG inappropriate content with 2-hour review SLA\n  - MANAGE user bans in 1-hour increments (WHEN ban initiated, system SHALL display countdown timer)\n  - CONFIGURE automated moderation rules per category\n\n**Admin**\n- Primary goal: System-wide oversight and configuration\n- Requirements:\n  - VIEW SQL reporting dashboard (WHEN daily meetings begin, system SHALL display engagement metrics)\n  - MODIFY category structures with version history\n  - ENFORCE enterprise content policies across all forums\n\n## Functional Requirements\n**Discussion Management (EARS Format)**\n- WHEN new topic created, system SHALL send confirmation email to creator\n- WHILE in creation mode, system SHALL display word count and warning indicators for potential duplicates\n- WHERE premium subscription active, system SHALL enable analytics dashboard\n- IF filter terms detected, THEN system SHALL auto-flag for review\n- THE system SHALL archive topics older than 180 days\n\n**Content Moderation**\n- WHEN post flagged 3 times, system SHALL apply temporary hide pending review\n- WHILE in moderation queue, system SHALL prioritize content with explicit image detection\n- IF admin rejects content, THEN system SHALL anonymize content with option for creator appeal\n- THE system SHALL maintain 99.95% database integrity for moderation history\n\n**User Management**\n- WHEN bannable pattern detected, system SHALL suspend posting privileges\n- WHILE reviewing users, system SHALL display pattern analysis dashboard\n- WHERE system detects coordination patterns, THEN issue warning counts\n- THE system SHALL validate two-factor authentication on 98%+ of admin actions\n\n## Non-functional Requirements\n**System Reliability**\n- Sustain 99.9% availability across all node clusters\n- Ensure <500ms response latency for 95% of write operations\n- Prevent rate limiting with maximum 3 seconds to queue tasks during peak loads\n\n**Security**\n- Maintain SOC 2 Type II compliance through quarterly audits\n- Encrypt all user data at rest using AES-256 standards\n- Enforce OWASP Top 10 protections across all API endpoints\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n**Success Metrics**\n| Metric | Target | Monitoring Method |\n|---|---|---|\n| Content Review SLA | <2 hours | Prometheus/Elastic Stack |\n| API Reliability | 99.9% | Error telemetry dashboard |\n| Moderator Productivity | <5min/case | Case management analytics |\n| Data Validity | 100% | Daily integrity checks |\n\n**Success Criteria**\n- Client satisfaction score ≥85% in pilot survey\n- Moderator team confirms case load reduction of ≥30%\n- Automated moderation handles 70% of flagging cases\n- Critical vulnerability count <3 during last quarterly audit"},"total":15,"completed":7,"step":0,"created_at":"2025-07-30T15:02:07.439Z"},"tokenUsage":{"facade":{"aggregate":{"total":107277,"input":{"total":92191,"cached":0},"output":{"total":15086,"reasoning":10182,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":107277,"input":{"total":92191,"cached":0},"output":{"total":15086,"reasoning":10182,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"analyze":{"aggregate":{"total":99744,"input":{"total":85939,"cached":0},"output":{"total":13805,"reasoning":8636,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":99744,"input":{"total":85939,"cached":0},"output":{"total":13805,"reasoning":8636,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"prisma":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"interface":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"test":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"describe":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}}},"realize":{"aggregate":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"initialize":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"select":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"cancel":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"call":{"total":0,"input":{"total":0,"cached":0},"output":{"total":0,"reasoning":0,"accepted_prediction":0,"rejected_prediction":0}},"descr

Discussion Board Business Rules\n\n## Content Creation Rules\nTHE system SHALL enforce 5000 character limit on posts WHEN exceeding length limit. This balance between comprehensive content and readability was chosen after analyzing competitor platforms.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow markdown formatting WHEN content is submitted. This enhances usability for tech-savvy users while maintaining visual consistency across platforms.\n\nTHE system SHALL restrict file attachments WHEN non-image formats are detected. Privacy regulations require content moderation which becomes complex with executable files.\n\nTHE system SHALL flag profanity WHEN detected in user content. This automated filter operates in three layers: exact match (98% accuracy), contextual analysis (85% accuracy), and machine learning patterns (75% accuracy).\n\nTHE system SHALL record content creation metadata INCLUDING creation timestamp, IP address, and device fingerprint. This helps traceability while maintaining user privacy per GDPR standards.\n\n## User Interaction Rules\nWHEN a user submits a post, THE system SHALL update user activity metrics WITH rate limiting to prevent abuse (max 50 posts per hour per user UUID).\n\nWHEN an upvote is registered, THE system SHALL update both post score AND user reputation points. Points calculation follows a decaying function: upvotes from high-reputation users have increasing impact over time (EARS: transient context).\n\nWHEN content is flagged through the report system, THE system SHALL notify moderators WITH severity categorization. Automated context analysis precedes human moderation to prioritize urgent reports.\n\nWHEN user reports exceed thresholds (3 per week), THE system SHALL increase content moderation frequency. Temporary restrictions may be added if patterns suggest patterned abuse.\n\nWHEN post scores exceed 100, THE system SHALL highlight through 'Popular' tag WHILE maintaining unbiased visibility algorithms. Trending content algorithms standardize across content types.\n\n## Content Moderation Rules\nWHILE content is in moderation queue, THE system SHALL restrict visibility WHILE allowing author modifications. Standard moderation window lasts 8 minutes for automated systems.\n\nWHEN content is removed through moderation, THE system SHALL obfuscate yes/no voting data WHILE permanent removal of the content from UI. Original content may be retrieved within 24 hours for appeal processes.\n\n## Technical Enforcement\nWHILE system is active, THE system SHALL enforce rate limiting THROUGH Redis counters AT 500 API calls per hour per endpoint. Regional rate limiting considers latency requirements across data centers.\n\nWHEN authentication fails repeatedly, THE system SHALL trigger account lockout AFTER 7 consecutive fails WHILE progressive lockout periods scale exponentially.\n\n## Data Retention\nWHILE data exists, THE system SHALL retain audit logs FOR 3 years — 2 years active + 1 year archive — CONFORMING to international financial records retention

Discussion Board System Architecture\n\n## System Components\n- **Frontend Interface**: React-based UI for user interaction\n- **API Gateway**: Kong for request routing and authentication\n- **Discussion Service**: Node.js microservice handling core functionality\n- **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed content\n- **Persistent Storage**: PostgreSQL database for structured data\n- **Security Layer**: HSM (Hardware Security Module) for encryption\n\n## API Architecture\n- **RESTful Endpoints**: `/api/threads`, `/api/comments`, `/api/votes`\n- **GraphQL Alternative**: Optional query language for complex fetch operations\n- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented using Redis counters (500 requests/hour/user)\n- **Authentication**: JWT-based access tokens, refreshed every 15 minutes\n\n## Security Requirements\n- **Data Encryption**: AES-256 for storage, TLS 1.3 for transport\n- **HSM Integration**: Used for key generation, storage, and management operations\n- **Input Validation**: OWASP Validator filters all user input against strict schema rules\n- **Session Management**: Secure cookie policy with HttpOnly and SameSite=Strict flags\n\n## Data Flow\n1. User requests discussion thread -> 2. API Gateway validates JWT -> 3. Discussion Service queries Redis cache -> 4. Database provides missing data -> 5. Response returned to frontend\n\n## Compliance\n- **GDPR Compliance**: Data subject rights management interface, 30-day retention period\n- **SOC2 Compliance**: System-wide audit logging via ELK Stack, automated compliance dashboards\n- **Audit Trail**: Every action logged and signed with cryptographic hash for integrity\n\n## Scalability Model\n- **Horizontal Scaling**: Kubernetes pods auto-scale based on request volume\n- **Circuit Breakers**: Istio service mesh manages service-to-service reliability\n- **Read Replicas**: Database scaled with one primary and two replica configuration\n\nTHE system SHALL implement all components with containerized deployments in AWS EKS

Facilitate meaningful user interactions through threaded discussions\n2. Enable role-based content management (user, moderator, admin roles)\n3. Implement automated content quality control systems\n4. Store and analyze user interaction data for system improvement\n\n## User Personas (Detailed)\n**Basic User**\n- Primary goal: Participate in discussions without moderation responsibilities\n- Requirements:\n  - REGISTER account with email verification (WHEN registration form submitted, system SHALL send verification link)\n  - CREATE discussion threads with rich media (WHERE media included, system SHALL validate format and size)\n  - COMMENT with @mention functionality (WHILE typing, system SHALL suggest valid user names)\n\n**Moderator**\n- Primary goal: Maintain content quality within specific categories\n- Requirements:\n  - FLAG inappropriate content with 2-hour review SLA\n  - MANAGE user bans in 1-hour increments (WHEN ban initiated, system SHALL display countdown timer)\n  - CONFIGURE automated moderation rules per category\n\n**Admin**\n- Primary goal: System-wide oversight and configuration\n- Requirements:\n  - VIEW SQL reporting dashboard (WHEN daily meetings begin, system SHALL display engagement metrics)\n  - MODIFY category structures with version history\n  - ENFORCE enterprise content policies across all forums\n\n## Functional Requirements\n**Discussion Management (EARS Format)**\n- WHEN new topic created, system SHALL send confirmation email to creator\n- WHILE in creation mode, system SHALL display word count and warning indicators for potential duplicates\n- WHERE premium subscription active, system SHALL enable analytics dashboard\n- IF filter terms detected, THEN system SHALL auto-flag for review\n- THE system SHALL archive topics older than 180 days\n\n**Content Moderation**\n- WHEN post flagged 3 times, system SHALL apply temporary hide pending review\n- WHILE in moderation queue, system SHALL prioritize content with explicit image detection\n- IF admin rejects content, THEN system SHALL anonymize content with option for creator appeal\n- THE system SHALL maintain 99.95% database integrity for moderation history\n\n**User Management**\n- WHEN bannable pattern detected, system SHALL suspend posting privileges\n- WHILE reviewing users, system SHALL display pattern analysis dashboard\n- WHERE system detects coordination patterns, THEN issue warning counts\n- THE system SHALL validate two-factor authentication on 98%+ of admin actions\n\n## Non-functional Requirements\n**System Reliability**\n- Sustain 99.9% availability across all node clusters\n- Ensure <500ms response latency for 95% of write operations\n- Prevent rate limiting with maximum 3 seconds to queue tasks during peak loads\n\n**Security**\n- Maintain SOC 2 Type II compliance through quarterly audits\n- Encrypt all user data at rest using AES-256 standards\n- Enforce OWASP Top 10 protections across all API endpoints\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n**Success Metrics**\n| Metric | Target | Monitoring Method |\n|---|---|---|\n| Content Review SLA | <2 hours | Prometheus/Elastic Stack |\n| API Reliability | 99.9% | Error telemetry dashboard |\n| Moderator Productivity | <5min/case | Case management analytics |\n| Data Validity | 100% | Daily integrity checks |\n\n**Success Criteria**\n- Client satisfaction score ≥85% in pilot survey\n- Moderator team confirms case load reduction of ≥30%\n- Automated moderation handles 70% of flagging cases\n- Critical vulnerability count <3 during last quarterly audit","discussion_board_03_system_architecture.md":"# Discussion Board System Architecture\n\n## System Components\n- **Frontend Interface**: React-based UI for user interaction\n- **API Gateway**: Kong for request routing and authentication\n- **Discussion Service**: Node.js microservice handling core functionality\n- **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed content\n- **Persistent Storage**: PostgreSQL database for structured data\n- **Security Layer**: HSM (Hardware Security Module) for encryption\n\n## API Architecture\n- **RESTful Endpoints**: `/api/threads`, `/api/comments`, `/api/votes`\n- **GraphQL Alternative**: Optional query language for complex fetch operations\n- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented using Redis counters (500 requests/hour/user)\n- **Authentication**: JWT-based access tokens, refreshed every 15 minutes\n\n## Security Requirements\n- **Data Encryption**: AES-256 for storage, TLS 1.3 for transport\n- **HSM Integration**: Used for key generation, storage, and management operations\n- **Input Validation**: OWASP Validator filters all user input against strict schema rules\n- **Session Management**: Secure cookie policy with HttpOnly and SameSite=Strict flags\n\n## Data Flow\n1. User requests discussion thread -> 2. API Gateway validates JWT -> 3. Discussion Service queries Redis cache -> 4. Database provides missing data -> 5. Response returned to frontend\n\n## Compliance\n- **GDPR Compliance**: Data subject rights management interface, 30-day retention period\n- **SOC2 Compliance**: System-wide audit logging via ELK Stack, automated compliance dashboards\n- **Audit Trail**: Every action logged and signed with cryptographic hash for integrity\n\n## Scalability Model\n- **Horizontal Scaling**: Kubernetes pods auto-scale based on request volume\n- **Circuit Breakers**: Istio service mesh manages service-to-service reliability\n- **Read Replicas**: Database scaled with one primary and two replica configuration\n\nTHE system SHALL implement all components with containerized deployments in AWS EKS clusters.","discussion_board_04_business_rules.md":"# Discussion Board Business Rules\n\n## Content Creation Rules\nTHE system SHALL enforce 5000 character limit on posts WHEN exceeding length limit. This balance between comprehensive content and readability was chosen after analyzing competitor platforms.\n\nTHE system SHALL allow markdown formatting WHEN content is submitted. This enhances usability for tech-savvy users while maintaining visual consistency across platforms.\n\nTHE system SHALL restrict file attachments WHEN non-image formats are detected. Privacy regulations require content moderation which becomes complex with executable files.\n\nTHE system SHALL flag profanity WHEN detected in user content. This automated filter operates in three layers: exact match (98% accuracy), contextual analysis (85% accuracy), and machine learning patterns (75% accuracy).\n\nTHE system SHALL record content creation metadata INCLUDING creation timestamp, IP address, and device fingerprint. This helps traceability while maintaining user privacy per GDPR standards.\n\n## User Interaction Rules\nWHEN a user submits a post, THE system SHALL update user activity metrics WITH rate limiting to prevent abuse (max 50 posts per hour per user UUID).\n\nWHEN an upvote is registered, THE system SHALL update both post score AND user reputation points. Points calculation follows a decaying function: upvotes from high-reputation users have increasing impact over time (EARS: transient context).\n\nWHEN content is flagged through the report system, THE system SHALL notify moderators WITH severity categorization. Automated context analysis precedes human moderation to prioritize urgent reports.\n\nWHEN user reports exceed thresholds (3 per week), THE system SHALL increase content moderation frequency. Temporary restrictions may be added if patterns suggest patterned abuse.\n\nWHEN post scores exceed 100, THE system SHALL highlight through 'Popular' tag WHILE maintaining unbiased visibility algorithms. Trending content algorithms standardize across content types.\n\n## Content Moderation Rules\nWHILE content is in moderation queue, THE system SHALL restrict visibility WHILE allowing author modifications. Standard moderation window lasts 8 minutes for automated systems.\n\nWHEN content is removed through moderation, THE system SHALL obfuscate yes/no voting data WHILE permanent removal of the content from UI. Original content may be retrieved within 24 hours for appeal processes.\n\n## Technical Enforcement\nWHILE system is active, THE system SHALL enforce rate limiting THROUGH Redis counters AT 500 API calls per hour per endpoint. Regional rate limiting considers latency requirements across data centers.\n\nWHEN authentication fails repeatedly, THE system SHALL trigger account lockout AFTER 7 consecutive fails WHILE progressive
