It supports advanced search capabilities including\npagination, sorting, and complex filtering by various user attributes.\n\nThe interface is designed for use with the PATCH /users endpoint which\nimplements filtered search operations. It enables clients to find specific\nusers or groups of users based on different criteria such as name, email,\nregistration date, and account status.\n\nSearch operations support both simple and compound conditions, allowing\nmultiple filters to be combined. The interface also supports sorting\nresults by different fields in ascending or descending order, and\nconfigurable pagination for handling large result sets.\n\nFor security purposes, search operations require authentication to prevent\nuser enumeration attacks. The results are filtered based on the requesting\nuser's permissions, potentially limiting visibility of users based on\nprivacy settings or organizational boundaries.\n\n@internal Generated from todo_list_user table in Prisma schema.
