# 12. Risks and Constraints

## Overview
This document enumerates the known risks and operational or business constraints related to the Internal Bulletin Board System (IBBS). These considerations must be factored into all project phases, from development through deployment and maintenance, to reduce negative impact and increase the system's chances of adoption and success.

---

## 1. Technical Risks

### 1.1 System Availability and Performance
- **Risk**: The system could become unavailable or slow during peak usage (e.g., company-wide announcements or heavy discussions).
- **Mitigation**: Architect for horizontal scalability, use load balancers, and monitor response times.

### 1.2 Data Integrity
- **Risk**: Possibility of data loss or corruption (e.g., simultaneous post edits, accidental deletions).
- **Mitigation**: Implement transactional operations, perform regular backups, and provide confirmation prompts for destructive actions.

### 1.3 Duplicate Actions Under Concurrency
- **Risk**: Simultaneous like/submit actions may result in duplicated data or race conditions.
- **Mitigation**: Enforce server-side idempotency and uniqueness constraints.

### 1.4 Browser & Device Compatibility
- **Risk**: The IBBS may not work consistently across all user devices and browsers.
- **Mitigation**: Adhere to web standards, conduct cross-browser/device testing.

### 1.5 Infrastructure Failures
- **Risk**: Hardware, network, or server outages may render the service inaccessible.
- **Mitigation**: Use fault-tolerant cloud infrastructure, redundancy, and monitoring.

### 1.6 Data Retention Policy for Hard Deletes
- **Risk**: Permanent removal of posts/comments (hard delete) risks accidental data loss with no recovery.
- **Mitigation**: Require user confirmation, log all delete actions, set up backup snapshots for a limited time.

## 2. Security & Compliance Risks

### 2.1 Unauthorized Access
- **Risk**: Non-employees or unapproved users gaining access to internal content.
- **Mitigation**: Enforce strict SSO and company email verification. Apply robust session management.

### 2.2 Weak Password Practices
- **Risk**: Users may not change their default password, increasing the chance of breaches.
- **Mitigation**: Make first-login password change mandatory and periodic password update reminders.

### 2.3 Data Privacy
- **Risk**: Exposure of sensitive company information (in posts/comments) if unauthorized users gain access.
- **Mitigation**: Ensure strict role-based access controls and audit logging. Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.

### 2.4 Compliance Violations
- **Risk**: System may unintentionally store or expose data in ways that violate company policies or relevant data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR).
- **Mitigation**: Regular compliance audits. Limit export/copy functions; document and seek legal review for all storage policies.

## 3. User Adoption and Usability Risks

### 3.1 Low Engagement
- **Risk**: Employees may not actively use the bulletin board, especially if it is not well integrated into daily workflows.
- **Mitigation**: Integrate notifications and highlight sticky announcements; conduct periodic user training and solicit feedback.

### 3.2 Usability Issues
- **Risk**: Complex workflows, confusing UI, or navigation challenges could lower adoption.
- **Mitigation**: Continuous usability testing; iterative UI/UX improvements based on analytics and user surveys.

## 4. Organizational Constraints

### 4.1 Change Management
- **Constraint**: Resistance to adopting new tools and workflows.
- **Mitigation**: Early stakeholder engagement, leadership support, clear communication of benefits.

### 4.2 Resource Limitations
- **Constraint**: Limited IT or operations staff for post-launch support and maintenance.
- **Mitigation**: Plan for self-service admin capabilities; budget for ongoing technical support.

### 4.3 Policy Alignment
- **Constraint**: System operations and moderation must align with existing company communication policies and labor regulations.
- **Mitigation**: Involve HR/compliance officers in requirements and periodic reviews.

## 5. System Limitations & Known Constraints

| Area | Constraint |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Authentication          | Only company emails; no external account integration |
| Recovery                | Hard deletions are irreversible—no recovery for deleted data |
| Audit/Moderation        | Limited historical tracking based on storage policy |
| Internationalization    | Initial release English-only; localization is out-of-scope for phase one |
| Notifications           | Native push/email notifications not required for MVP |
| Cross-system Integration| No auto-integration with calendars, HR, or chat in MVP |

## 6. Operational Risks

- **Planned Maintenance**: Brief downtime for upgrades/maintenance could disrupt usage if not properly scheduled and communicated.
- **Upgrade Paths**: Need for backward-compatible database migrations and rolling updates to avoid service disruptions.

## 7. Examples of Risk Scenarios
- If a critical announcement is not delivered due to a service outage, company-wide communication could be impaired.
- Lax authentication could let a former employee or outsider post malicious content.
- If the UI discourages participation, important discussions will move to unofficial channels and knowledge may be lost.
- Accidental deletion of an important announcement is final, which could have operational ramifications.

## 8. Risk Mitigation Best Practices
- Document and review all risks regularly.
- Create a playbook for incident response and recovery.
- Adopt continuous monitoring with clear alerting systems for security, uptime, and performance.
- Use regular user feedback to identify shifting risks and constraints.
