# 6. Non-Functional Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the non-functional requirements (NFRs) for the Internal Bulletin Board System (IBBS). These requirements define the system's operational attributes, such as performance, reliability, scalability, usability, maintainability, security (beyond base functional aspects), compliance, localization, and accessibility. Adherence to these NFRs is critical for ensuring a robust, user-friendly, and sustainable platform.

---

## 1. Performance
- **Response Time:** All primary system interactions (e.g., posting, commenting, navigation, likes) must complete within 2 seconds under normal network conditions.
- **Page Load:** Initial page load (after authentication) must occur within 3 seconds for 95% of requests.
- **Simultaneous Users:** The system must support a minimum of 500 concurrent users without degradation in response times.
- **Optimized Queries:** Database queries should be optimized to reduce latency, especially for listing popular posts and aggregation features.

## 2. Scalability
- **Horizontal Scalability:** The platform must support scaling horizontally as the number of users or content increases. Infrastructure should allow the addition of resources (servers, storage) with minimal reconfiguration.
- **Growth Planning:** The architecture should allow for future board types and feature expansion without major redesigns.

## 3. Reliability & Availability
- **System Uptime:** The platform must achieve 99.9% uptime, excluding scheduled maintenance, measured monthly.
- **Error Recovery:** Automatic recovery from server or network failures is required; user sessions must persist (where secure and appropriate) across brief disruptions.
- **Data Consistency:** All user actions (posts, comments, likes) must be processed transactionally to prevent data loss or duplication.

## 4. Security (NFRs Beyond Functional Scope)
- **Session Management:** Enforce automatic logout after 30 minutes of inactivity; sessions must expire and require re-authentication.
- **Data Encryption:** All sensitive data (passwords, session tokens, user metadata) must be encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+).
- **Audit Logging:** All access, login, and content modification events must be logged securely for at least 6 months for auditing purposes.
- **Compliance Alignment:** Follow best practices for information security (e.g., ISO 27001, company IT standards).

## 5. Maintainability
- **Code Modularity:** System architecture must separate core modules (authentication, boards, posts, notifications, etc.) to facilitate updates and feature enhancements.
- **Documentation:** Up-to-date technical documentation and admin guides must be maintained.
- **Logging & Diagnostics:** Comprehensive log tracing and error diagnostics must be built-in to support troubleshooting, with logs stored securely offsite.

## 6. Usability
- **Accessibility:** All UIs must conform to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (e.g., readable font sizes, keyboard navigation, alt-text for images).
- **Consistency:** Navigation, button placement, and feedback/error messaging must be universal throughout the product (per design guidelines).
- **Help & Onboarding:** Provide contextual tooltips and a digital quick-start guide for first-time users.

## 7. Localization & Internationalization
- **Language Support:** Initial deployment will use English. Content, labels, and system messages must be adaptable for additional languages with minimal code changes.
- **Date/Time Formatting:** Date and time displays should respect user locale settings.

## 8. Compliance
- **Data Privacy:** The system must comply with local privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR if applicable). No unnecessary data retention beyond operating needs.
- **Legal Notices:** Terms of use and privacy policy links must be clear and accessible from all screens.

## 9. Monitoring & Analytics
- **Usage Monitoring:** Integrate monitoring to track key metrics: active users, post volumes, error rates.
- **Alerting:** Automated alerts for abnormal system conditions (uptime, errors, performance bottlenecks) must be configured for rapid response.

Is there anything else to refine for this document before proceeding to the next section: [7_board_structure_and_content_management.md]? If not, I will begin drafting the next section as per the project plan.
