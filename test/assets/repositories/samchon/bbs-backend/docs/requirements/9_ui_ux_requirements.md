# 9. UI/UX Requirements

## Overview
This document specifies the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) requirements for the Internal Bulletin Board System (IBBS), serving as the definitive reference for design and frontend developers. It describes the layout paradigm, navigation structure, component placement, interaction flows, usability expectations, accessibility needs, and visual hierarchy that must be implemented.

---

## 1. Layout Principles & Anatomy

### 1.1 Page Structure
- **Persistent Left Navigation Bar:**
  - Located on every page, vertically aligned.
  - Contains a list of board types: **Announcements**, **Free Board**, **Popular Board**.
  - Includes a prominent **“New Post”** button, distinctively styled for discoverability.
- **Content Panel:**
  - Central area displays board posts, comments, or post editor, depending on the context.
  - Responsive design ensuring compatibility across desktop and mobile web browsers.
- **Top Bar (Header):**
  - Aligned to the top right: user status (login/logout), password change, and account info.
  - Corporate branding/logo on the left (not configurable by users).

### 1.2 Component Placement
- All action buttons (e.g., New Post, Edit, Delete, Like) should have clear states: enabled, hovered, disabled.
- Primary CTAs (e.g., "Post", "Submit", "Save") must use a standout accent color in line with company branding.

---

## 2. Navigation & User Flows
- Navigation between boards is instant and does not reload the entire page (SPA-like feel).
- Users should always know which board and which post they are viewing, via breadcrumbs or clear headers.
- The "New Post" button should always route to the post creation editor for the currently selected board.
- Posts should have a prominent, easy-access back button/link to return to the board view.
- From any comment or reply, users can return to the parent post without losing scroll position or context.

---

## 3. Authentication & Access-Related UI
- Unauthenticated users land on a **login screen**; no other app content (including post titles or comments) is visible.
- The **first login experience** requires a password change prompt before granting any further access.
- After login, the UI greets the user by name ("Welcome, [Username]").
- Logout returns the user to the login screen and clears all sensitive state.
- Display appropriate error and helper messages for login failure, password rules, etc., with accessible styling.

---

## 4. Posting & Commenting Experience
- **Post List View:**
  - Shows metadata: post title, author, timestamp, like count.
  - Posts can be filtered by board type; popular posts are visually labeled (e.g., star icon or highlight).
- **Post Detail View:**
  - Displays full post, metadata, action buttons, and nested comments.
  - Comments and replies appear in a structured, indented format for clarity.
  - Avatars or user initials next to author names (optional, if available).
- **New Post/Edit Post Modal/Screen:**
  - Rich text editor or, at minimum, multi-line input with basic formatting.
  - Attachments or media are out-of-scope unless later specified.

---

## 5. Usability & Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation must be fully supported for all controls and workflows.
- Color contrast meets or exceeds [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) standards.
- All actionable UI elements must have visible focus states.
- Support for screen reader labels/ARIA roles for navigation, post actions, and notifications.
- Tooltips or micro-copy are present for all icons or non-labeled buttons.
- Error states and loading indicators provided for all async actions.

---

## 6. Visual Consistency & Branding
- Single consistent font stack matching corporate style guide.
- Use of spacing, dividers, and color to separate boards, posts, comments for easy scanning.
- Brand colors and logo fixed on the layout (not user-customizable).

---

## 7. Specific Component Guidelines
- **Left Navigation:**
  - Current board highlighted (e.g., bold, colored bar, or background shade).
- **Like Buttons:**
  - One-click toggle, visually indicates if user has already liked.
  - Likes are shown as a count next to icon.
- **Password Change:**
  - Easy-to-find in the top right menu.
  - Cannot be skipped on first login (modal blocks interaction).
- **Delete Actions:**
  - Use confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental deletion.
- **Mobile Considerations:**
  - Nav bar collapses or becomes a burger menu.
  - All tap targets sized for comfortable touch use.

## 9. Additional Guidelines
- Consistent feedback on actions: loading spinners, success toasts, and error alerts.
- Minimal unnecessary modal dialogs or popups; use inline feedback where practical.
- Place all non-critical configuration/settings in an unobtrusive, secondary menu.
