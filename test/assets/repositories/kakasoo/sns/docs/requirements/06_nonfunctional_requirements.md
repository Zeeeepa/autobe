## 1. Performance

| Requirement                       | Specification                                            |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Response Time                     | 95% of user actions should complete < 1.5 seconds.      |
| Feed Rendering Time               | Personalized feed loads in < 2 seconds for most users.  |
| Search Query Latency              | Search returns results within 1 second.                 |
| Data Update Propagation           | Profile and content updates are visible in < 5 seconds. |

## 2. Scalability

- **User Growth:** The system must support seamless scaling from launch (<10,000) to >1 million active users.
- **Elastic Architecture:** Cloud-native deployment supporting horizontal scaling of frontend, backend, and data layers.
- **Load Management:** System handles spikes of up to 10x normal traffic without degradation.

## 3. Security

- **Authentication:** All accounts require email/phone verification. Support 2FA and strong password policies.
- **Data Encryption:** All data in transit encrypted with TLS 1.2+/SSL; sensitive user data encrypted at rest.
- **Secure APIs:** Input validation, rate limiting, CSRF and XSS mitigations on all endpoints.
- **Session Management:** Automatic logout after 30 minutes of inactivity. Session tokens expire after logout.
- **Audit Logs:** Critical user actions (profile edits, new connections, messaging) logged for audit trails.

## 4. Privacy

- **GDPR Compliance:** Users can export or delete their data at any time. Explicit consent for data processing.
- **Privacy Controls:** Profile visibility, connection requests, messaging permissions user-configurable.
- **Data Minimization:** Collect only data necessary for platform operation; anonymize analytics data.

## 5. Usability

- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance; full keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully functional on all modern web browsers and devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Onboarding Guidelines:** New users guided through profile setup, privacy controls, and finding connections.

## 6. Reliability & Availability

| Requirement              | Specification                                                   |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Uptime                   | 99.9% monthly uptime (excluding planned maintenance)            |
| Disaster Recovery        | RTO < 2 hours, RPO < 30 minutes in case of data loss or outage  |
| Data Backup              | Nightly encrypted backup with regular restore verification      |
| Monitoring               | Real-time application and infrastructure health monitoring      |

## 7. Maintainability

- **Modular Architecture:** Components decoupled for easier updates and testing.
- **Documentation:** User-facing and internal documentation maintained and regularly updated.
- **Automated Testing:** Unit, integration, and regression test suites executed before releases.
- **Configurable Feature Flags:** Allow safe rollout and rollback of new features.

## 8. Legal & Compliance

- Compliance with applicable labor law, data protection, copyright, and anti-discrimination requirements in all operating countries.

## 9. Internationalization (as roadmap)

- Service localization for multiple regions and languages. Support Unicode inputs throughout UI and backend.
