# 10. Search & Recommendations System

## 1. Overview
The Search & Recommendation system is a critical feature of the career-focused social networking platform, enabling users to discover people, jobs, content, and networking opportunities effectively. It must balance precision, personalization, speed, and relevance while respecting privacy and scalability constraints.

## 2. Search System Design
### a. Supported Search Entities
- **People (Users/Professionals):** By name, job title, skills, location, company, education, experience.
- **Jobs:** By title, company, location, required skills, employment type.
- **Content:** Posts, articles, shared media (by keywords, hashtags, topics, author).
- **Companies/Organizations:** By industry, location, size, description, open roles.

### b. Search Parameters & Filters
| Entity     | Primary Parameters              | Filters/Facets                                   |
|------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|

## 3. Recommendation Engine
### a. Core Recommendation Types
- **People You May Know:** Based on mutual connections, overlapping skills, industry proximity, education, and endorsements.
- **Jobs For You:** Matching skills, work history, current interests, engagement data (e.g., profile views or applications).
- **Content Suggestions:** Recent posts, trending topics in user’s field, contributions from close connections.
- **Companies To Follow:** Based on user’s career trajectory, interests, and network activity.

### b. Recommendation Algorithms
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Suggest connections or content by leveraging social graph and behavioral similarities.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends jobs/posts based on user’s explicit profile data, preferences, and engagement.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combines behavior signals (likes, saves, applications) with profile-based analysis.
- **Contextual Relevance:** Recommendations are weighted by recency, frequency, and depth of user engagement.

### c. Degree of Personalization
- Recommendations are personalized dynamically based on user actions, explicit feedback (e.g., hiding a job), and evolving profile data.

---

## 4. Relevance Determination & Evaluation
- **Ranking:** Search results and recommendations are ranked by multiple weighted factors: profile match, engagement, recentness, connections.
- **Feedback Loops:** User interactions (clicks, skips, hides, connects) adjust future result weighting.
- **Quality Metrics:** Precision, recall, click-through rate, satisfaction surveys inform ongoing tuning.

---

## 5. Privacy, Security & Fairness
- Ensure private profiles/data are not exposed in search or recommendations beyond allowed scopes (per-user privacy settings).
- Prevent filter bubbles and bias by adding exploration features (e.g., “discover someone new” or “outside my industry” prompts).
- Support opt-in/out for appearing in certain types of recommendations.

## 6. Example User Flows & Screens
### a. People Search Flow
1. User opens Search tab and enters a keyword (e.g., "Data Scientist").
2. Platform suggests user profiles, skills, and trending topics in real time.
3. Results are displayed with facets to filter by location, company, experience.
4. User clicks on a profile and can connect or save for later review.

### b. Job Recommendation Flow
1. User visits the Jobs section or updates their profile.
2. System recommends listed jobs based on profile matching and similar applicants’ behavior.
3. User can bookmark, apply, or hide specific jobs to train the recommendation system further.

## 7. Future Enhancements
- Add advanced semantic/natural language search.
- Network graph exploration tool for discovering indirect connections.
- Explainability interface ("Why was this recommended to me?").
