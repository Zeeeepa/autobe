   * continue gathering information through conversation instead.
   *
   * The agent will automatically generate follow-up questions for any ambiguous
   * requirements and continuously refine its understanding through iterative
   * conversation. When executed after other agents have generated code, it can
   * also interpret change requests in the context of existing implementations.
