/**
 * Function calling interface for fixing TypeScript type casting and assignment
 * errors.
 *
 * This interface is used by the CommonCorrectCasting agent to fix TypeScript
 * compilation errors related to type casting and type assignment
 * incompatibilities in any TypeScript code, not limited to e2e tests.
 *
 * The agent handles various type casting issues including:
 *
 * - **Typia tag type incompatibilities**: Format tag mismatches (e.g.,
 *   Format<"uuid"> vs Pattern<...>), type constraint incompatibilities (e.g.,
 *   Type<"int32"> vs Type<"int32"> & Minimum<0>), nullable type conversions
 *   with tags
 * - **Date to string conversions**: Date to string, Date to string &
 *   Format<"date-time">, nullable Date handling
 * - **Nullable and undefined type assignments**: Exhaustive type narrowing for T
 *   | null | undefined patterns
 * - **String to literal type assignments**: Converting general string to literal
 *   union types (e.g., "pending" | "approved" | "rejected")
 * - **Optional chaining with union types**: Handling boolean | undefined results
 *   from array methods like includes()
 * - **Type narrowing "no overlap" errors**: Removing redundant comparisons after
 *   TypeScript's control flow analysis

  /**
   * Rewrite function to fix type casting and assignment errors.
   *
   * This function is called when the agent detects any type casting or
   * assignment related compilation error patterns.
   *
   * The agent applies various fix strategies based on the error type:
   *
   * - **Typia tag incompatibilities**: Uses `satisfies ... as ...` pattern to
   *   strip incompatible tags, or `typia.assert<T>()` as a last resort
   * - **Date conversions**: Uses `.toISOString()` method for Date to string
   *   conversions
   * - **Nullable type narrowing**: Applies exhaustive checks (e.g., !== null &&
   *   !== undefined)
   * - **typia.assert vs assertGuard**: Uses assert for value assignment,
   *   assertGuard for type narrowing
   * - **Literal type conversions**: Uses `typia.assert<T>()` for runtime
   *   validation
   * - **Optional chaining results**: Uses `=== true` or `??` operators
   * - **"No overlap" errors**: Removes redundant comparisons
