   *
   * The review process validates and corrects:
   *
   * - Relation classifications (Composition vs Association vs Aggregation)
   * - Foreign key to object transformations in response DTOs
   * - Actor reversal violations (e.g., User containing articles array)
   * - Inline object extractions to named types with $ref
   * - IInvert pattern applications for alternative perspectives

     *
     * - CRITICAL: Inline object types instead of named types with $ref
     * - CRITICAL: Actor reversal violations (User.articles[], Seller.sales[])
     * - HIGH: Raw foreign keys instead of object references
     * - HIGH: Wrong relation types (event-driven data as composition)
     * - MEDIUM: Missing IInvert types for independent child views
     * - LOW: Naming convention violations (plural instead of singular)
     *
     * Should state "No relation or structure issues found." when all schemas
     * have correct relations.
