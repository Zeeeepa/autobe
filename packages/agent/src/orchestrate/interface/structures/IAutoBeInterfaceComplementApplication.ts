     * TypeScript draft code for complement schema definitions.
     *
     * This property contains TypeScript interface definitions for missing
     * schema types that were referenced but not defined in the initial schema
     * generation. Similar to the main schema draft, this serves as a
     * preliminary TypeScript representation before converting to JSON Schema
     * format.
     *
     * The draft helps ensure that complementary schemas maintain consistency
     * with the existing type system and follow the same conventions as the
     * primary schemas.
     *
     * This draft typically includes:
     *
     * - Missing entity interfaces referenced via $ref
     * - Nested object types used within other schemas
     * - Shared utility types or enumerations
     * - Any transitively referenced types
     *
     * The final schemas in the `schemas` property should be validated against
     * and derived from this TypeScript draft to ensure type safety and
     * consistency across the entire API specification.
     *
     * Example complement draft:
     *
     * ```typescript
     * interface IUserProfile {
     *   id: string;
     *   userId: string;
     *   displayName: string;
     *   avatarUrl?: string;
     * }
     *
     * interface IAddress {
     *   street: string;
     *   city: string;
     *   postalCode: string;
     * }
     * ```

    /**
     * A collection of missing schema definitions that need to be added to the
     * OpenAPI document's `components.schemas` section.
     *
     * This object contains schema definitions for types that are referenced but
     * not yet defined:
     *
     * - Key: Schema name (`string`): The name of the schema type that will be
     *   referenced in $ref statements
     * - Value: `AutoBeOpenApi.IJsonSchema` - The complete JSON Schema definition
     *   for that type
     *
     * Example structure:
     *
     * ```typescript
     * [
     *   {
     *     key: "IUserProfile",
     *     description: "User profile information",
     *     value: {
     *       type: "object",
     *       properties: {
     *         id: { type: "string" },
     *         userId: { type: "string" },
     *         displayName: { type: "string" },
     *         avatarUrl: { type: "string", nullable: true },
     *       },
     *       required: ["id", "userId", "displayName"],
     *     },
     *   },
     *   {
     *     key: "IAddress",
     *     description: "Physical address information",
     *     value: {
     *       type: "object",
     *       properties: {
     *         street: { type: "string" },
     *         city: { type: "string" },
     *         postalCode: { type: "string" },

     *       required: ["street", "city", "postalCode"],
     *     },
     *   },
     * ];
     * ```
     *
     * Each schema definition follows the JSON Schema specification and will be
     * directly inserted into the OpenAPI document's components.schemas section,
     * making them available for $ref references throughout the API
     * specification.
