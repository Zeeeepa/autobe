  /**

   * {@link path}, {@link parameters path parameters},
   * {@link requestBody request body}, and {@link responseBody} structure. It
   * corresponds to an individual operation in the paths section of an OpenAPI
   * document.
   *
   * Each operation requires a detailed explanation of its purpose through the
   * reason and description fields, making it clear why the API was designed and
   * how it should be used.
   *
   * DO: Use object types for all request bodies and responses. DO: Reference
   * named types defined in the components section. DO: Use `application/json`
   * as the content-type. DO: Use `string & tags.Format<"uri">` in the schema
   * for file upload/download operations instead of binary data formats.
   *
   * In OpenAPI, this might represent:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "/shoppings/customers/orders": {
   *     "post": {
   *       "description": "Create a new order application from shopping cart...",

    /**
     * Authorization roles required to access this API operation.
     *
     * This field specifies which user roles are allowed to access this
     * endpoint. Multiple roles can be specified to allow different types of
     * users to access the same endpoint.
     *
     * ## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Role Multiplication Effect
     *
     * **EACH ROLE IN THIS ARRAY GENERATES A SEPARATE ENDPOINT**
     *
     * - If you specify `["admin", "moderator", "member"]`, this creates 3
     *   separate endpoints
     * - Total generated endpoints = operations √ó average roles.length
     * - Example: 100 operations with 3 roles each = 300 actual endpoints
     *
     * ## üî¥ AVOID OVER-GENERATION
     *
     * **DO NOT create role-specific endpoints when a public endpoint would
     * suffice:**
     *
     * - ‚ùå BAD: Separate GET endpoints for admin, member, moderator to view the
     *   same public data
     * - ‚úÖ GOOD: Single public endpoint `[]` with role-based filtering in business
     *   logic
     *
     * **DO NOT enumerate all possible roles when the Prisma schema uses a
     * single User table:**
     *
     * - If Prisma has a User table with role/permission fields, you likely only
     *   need `["user"]`
     * - Avoid listing `["admin", "seller", "buyer", "moderator", ...]`
     *   unnecessarily
     * - The actual role checking happens in business logic, not at the endpoint
     *   level
     *
     * ## Naming Convention
     *
     * DO: Use camelCase for all role names.
     *
     * ## Important Guidelines
     *
     * - Set to empty array `[]` for public endpoints that require no
     *   authentication
     * - Set to array with role strings for role-restricted endpoints
     * - **MINIMIZE the number of roles per endpoint to prevent explosion**
     * - Consider if the endpoint can be public with role-based filtering instead
     * - The role names match exactly with the user type/role defined in the
     *   database
     * - This will be used by the Realize Agent to generate appropriate decorator
     *   and authorization logic in the provider functions
     * - The controller will apply the corresponding authentication decorator
     *   based on these roles
     *
     * ## Examples
     *
     * - `[]` - Public endpoint, no authentication required (PREFERRED for read
     *   operations)
     * - `["user"]` - Any authenticated user can access (PREFERRED for
     *   user-specific operations)
     * - `["admin"]` - Only admin users can access (USE SPARINGLY)
     * - `["admin", "moderator"]` - Both admin and moderator users can access
     *   (AVOID if possible)
     * - `["seller"]` - Only seller users can access (ONLY if Seller is a separate
     *   table)
     *
     * ## Best Practices
     *
     * 1. **Start with public `[]` for all read operations** unless sensitive data
     *    is involved
     * 2. **Use single role `["user"]` for authenticated operations** and handle
     *    permissions in business logic
     * 3. **Only use multiple roles when absolutely necessary** for different
     *    business logic paths
     * 4. **Remember: Fewer roles = Fewer endpoints = Better performance and
     *    maintainability**
     *
     * Note: The actual authentication/authorization implementation will be
     * handled by decorators at the controller level, and the provider function
     * will receive the authenticated user object with the appropriate type.
