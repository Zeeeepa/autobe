     *
     * ## Reserved Word Restrictions
     *
     * CRITICAL: The name MUST NOT be a TypeScript/JavaScript reserved word, as
     * it will be used as a class method name in generated code. Avoid names
     * like:
     *
     * - `delete`, `for`, `if`, `else`, `while`, `do`, `switch`, `case`, `break`
     * - `continue`, `function`, `return`, `with`, `in`, `of`, `instanceof`
     * - `typeof`, `void`, `var`, `let`, `const`, `class`, `extends`, `import`
     * - `export`, `default`, `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `new`
     * - `super`, `this`, `null`, `true`, `false`, `async`, `await`
     * - `yield`, `static`, `private`, `protected`, `public`, `implements`
     * - `interface`, `package`, `enum`, `debugger`
     *
     * Instead, use alternative names for these operations:
     *
     * - Use `erase` instead of `delete`
     * - Use `iterate` instead of `for`
     * - Use `when` instead of `if`
     * - Use `cls` instead of `class`
     *
     * ## Standard Endpoint Names
     *
     * Use these conventional names based on the endpoint's primary function:
     *
     * - **`index`**: List/search operations that return multiple entities
     *
     *   - Typically used with PATCH method for complex queries
     *   - Example: `PATCH /users` → `name: "index"`
     * - **`at`**: Retrieve a specific entity by identifier
     *
     *   - Typically used with GET method on single resource
     *   - Example: `GET /users/{userId}` → `name: "at"`
     * - **`create`**: Create a new entity
     *
     *   - Typically used with POST method
     *   - Example: `POST /users` → `name: "create"`
     * - **`update`**: Update an existing entity
     *
     *   - Typically used with PUT method
     *   - Example: `PUT /users/{userId}` → `name: "update"`
     * - **`erase`**: Delete/remove an entity (NOT `delete` - reserved word!)
     *
     *   - Typically used with DELETE method
     *   - Example: `DELETE /users/{userId}` → `name: "erase"`
     *
     * ## Custom Endpoint Names
     *
     * For specialized operations beyond basic CRUD, use descriptive verbs:
     *
     * - **`activate`**: Enable or turn on a feature/entity
     * - **`deactivate`**: Disable or turn off a feature/entity
     * - **`approve`**: Approve a request or entity
     * - **`reject`**: Reject a request or entity
     * - **`publish`**: Make content publicly available
     * - **`archive`**: Move to archived state
     * - **`restore`**: Restore from archived/deleted state
     * - **`duplicate`**: Create a copy of an entity
     * - **`transfer`**: Move ownership or change assignment
     * - **`validate`**: Validate data or state
     * - **`process`**: Execute a business process or workflow
     * - **`export`**: Generate downloadable data
     * - **`import`**: Process uploaded data
     *
     * ## Naming Guidelines
     *
     * - MUST use camelCase naming convention
     * - Use singular verb forms
     * - Be concise but descriptive
     * - Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood
     * - Ensure the name clearly represents the endpoint's primary action
     * - For nested resources, focus on the action rather than hierarchy
     * - NEVER use JavaScript/TypeScript reserved words
     *
     * Valid Examples:
     *
     * - `index`, `create`, `update`, `erase` (single word)
     * - `updatePassword`, `cancelOrder`, `publishArticle` (camelCase)
     * - `validateEmail`, `generateReport`, `exportData` (camelCase)
     *
     * Invalid Examples:
     *
     * - `update_password` (snake_case not allowed)
     * - `UpdatePassword` (PascalCase not allowed)
     * - `update-password` (kebab-case not allowed)
     *
     * Path to Name Examples:
     *
     * - `GET /shopping/orders/{orderId}/items` → `name: "index"` (lists items)
     * - `POST /shopping/orders/{orderId}/cancel` → `name: "cancel"`
     * - `PUT /users/{userId}/password` → `name: "updatePassword"`
     *
     * ## Uniqueness Rule
     *
     * The `name` must be unique within the API's accessor namespace. The
     * accessor is formed by combining the path segments (excluding parameters)
     * with the operation name.
     *
     * Accessor formation:
     *
     * 1. Extract non-parameter segments from the path (remove `{...}` parts)
     * 2. Join segments with dots
     * 3. Append the operation name
     *
     * Examples:
     *
     * - Path: `/shopping/sale/{saleId}/review/{reviewId}`, Name: `at` → Accessor:
     *   `shopping.sale.review.at`
     * - Path: `/users/{userId}/posts`, Name: `index` → Accessor:
     *   `users.posts.index`
     * - Path: `/auth/login`, Name: `signIn` → Accessor: `auth.login.signIn`
     *
     * Each accessor must be globally unique across the entire API. This ensures
     * operations can be uniquely identified in generated SDKs and prevents
     * naming conflicts.

    name: string & CamelCasePattern;

    /**
     * Authorization roles required to access this API operation.
     *
     * This field specifies which user roles are allowed to access this
     * endpoint. Multiple roles can be specified to allow different types of
     * users to access the same endpoint.
     *
     * ## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Role Multiplication Effect
     *
     * **EACH ROLE IN THIS ARRAY GENERATES A SEPARATE ENDPOINT**
     *
     * - If you specify `["admin", "moderator", "member"]`, this creates 3
     *   separate endpoints
     * - Total generated endpoints = operations × average roles.length
     * - Example: 100 operations with 3 roles each = 300 actual endpoints
     *
     * ## 🔴 AVOID OVER-GENERATION
     *
     * **DO NOT create role-specific endpoints when a public endpoint would
     * suffice:**
     *
     * - ❌ BAD: Separate GET endpoints for admin, member, moderator to view the
     *   same public data
     * - ✅ GOOD: Single public endpoint `[]` with role-based filtering in business
     *   logic
     *
     * **DO NOT enumerate all possible roles when the Prisma schema uses a
     * single User table:**
     *
     * - If Prisma has a User table with role/permission fields, you likely only
     *   need `["user"]`
     * - Avoid listing `["admin", "seller", "buyer", "moderator", ...]`
     *   unnecessarily
     * - The actual role checking happens in business logic, not at the endpoint
     *   level
     *
     * ## Naming Convention
     *
     * DO: Use camelCase for all role names.
     *
     * ## Important Guidelines
     *
     * - Set to empty array `[]` for public endpoints that require no
     *   authentication
     * - Set to array with role strings for role-restricted endpoints
     * - **MINIMIZE the number of roles per endpoint to prevent explosion**
     * - Consider if the endpoint can be public with role-based filtering instead
     * - The role names match exactly with the user type/role defined in the
     *   database
     * - This will be used by the Realize Agent to generate appropriate decorator
     *   and authorization logic in the provider functions
     * - The controller will apply the corresponding authentication decorator
     *   based on these roles
     *
     * ## Examples
     *
     * - `[]` - Public endpoint, no authentication required (PREFERRED for read
     *   operations)
     * - `["user"]` - Any authenticated user can access (PREFERRED for
     *   user-specific operations)
     * - `["admin"]` - Only admin users can access (USE SPARINGLY)
     * - `["admin", "moderator"]` - Both admin and moderator users can access
     *   (AVOID if possible)
     * - `["seller"]` - Only seller users can access (ONLY if Seller is a separate
     *   table)
     *
     * ## Best Practices
     *
     * 1. **Start with public `[]` for all read operations** unless sensitive data
     *    is involved
     * 2. **Use single role `["user"]` for authenticated operations** and handle
     *    permissions in business logic
     * 3. **Only use multiple roles when absolutely necessary** for different
     *    business logic paths
     * 4. **Remember: Fewer roles = Fewer endpoints = Better performance and
     *    maintainability**
     *
     * Note: The actual authentication/authorization implementation will be
     * handled by decorators at the controller level, and the provider function
     * will receive the authenticated user object with the appropriate type.
