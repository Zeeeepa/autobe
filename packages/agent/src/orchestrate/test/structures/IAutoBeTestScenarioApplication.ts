    /**
     * Descriptive function name derived from the user scenario.
     *
     * The function name serves as a concise, technical identifier that clearly
     * represents the specific user scenario being described. It should be
     * immediately understandable and directly correspond to the user situation
     * without requiring additional context.
     *
     * ## Naming Convention
     *
     * - Must start with `test_` prefix (mandatory requirement)
     * - Use snake_case formatting throughout
     * - Include the primary user action (create, get, update, delete, list, etc.)
     * - Specify the target resource (user, product, order, profile, etc.)
     * - Add scenario-specific context (valid_data, invalid_email, not_found,
     *   etc.)
     *
     * ## Content Structure
     *
     * Function names should follow this pattern:
     * `test_[user_action]_[resource]_[scenario_context]`
     *
     * Where:
     *
     * - `user_action`: What the user is trying to do
     * - `resource`: What the user is interacting with
     * - `scenario_context`: The specific situation or condition
     *
     * ## User-Focused Examples
     *
     * - `test_create_user_profile_with_complete_information` - User providing all
     *   available profile data
     * - `test_retrieve_user_profile_when_profile_exists` - User accessing their
     *   existing profile
     * - `test_update_user_email_with_valid_new_address` - User changing their
     *   email to a valid new one
     * - `test_delete_user_account_when_user_lacks_permission` - User attempting
     *   account deletion without authorization
     * - `test_search_user_profiles_with_pagination_preferences` - User browsing
     *   profiles with specific pagination
     *
     * ## Clarity Guidelines
     *
     * - Prioritize clarity over brevity
     * - Avoid technical jargon or implementation terms
     * - Use terminology that reflects user perspective
     * - Ensure the name alone conveys the user's intent
     * - Make it understandable to non-technical stakeholders
     * - Keep consistent with user scenario description
     *
     * ## Single Endpoint Alignment
     *
     * Function names must reflect scenarios that:
     *
     * - Accomplish user goals through this single endpoint only
     * - Don't imply dependency on other API operations
     * - Represent complete user interactions
