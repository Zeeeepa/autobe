    /**
     * Descriptive function name derived from the user scenario.

     * The function name serves as a concise, technical identifier that clearly
     * represents the specific user scenario being described. It should be
     * immediately understandable and directly correspond to the user situation
     * without requiring additional context.
     *
     * ## Naming Convention
     *
     * DO: Use snake_case naming convention.
     *
     * - Must start with `test_api_` prefix (mandatory requirement)
     * - ALWAYS start with business feature, NOT action verbs
     * - Business feature comes first, followed by scenario context
     * - Embed action verbs within the scenario description, not at the beginning
     *
     * ## Content Structure
     *
     * Function names should follow this pattern:
     * `test_api_[core_feature]_[specific_scenario]`
     *
     * Where:
     *
     * - `core_feature`: The main business feature or entity being tested
     *   (customer, seller, cart, push_message, etc.)
     * - `specific_scenario`: The specific operation or scenario context
     *   (join_verification_not_found, login_success,
     *   moderator_assignment_update, discountable_ticket_duplicated,
     *   csv_export, etc.)
     *
     * ## Business Feature-Based Examples
     *
     * - `test_api_customer_join_verification_not_found` - Customer join
     *   verification when verification code not found
     * - `test_api_seller_login` - Seller login operation
     * - `test_api_cart_discountable_ticket_duplicated` - Cart discountable ticket
     *   with duplication scenario
     * - `test_api_push_message_csv` - Push message functionality with CSV format
     * - `test_api_product_review_update` - Product review update operation
     *
     * ## Clarity Guidelines
     *
     * - Prioritize clarity over brevity
     * - Avoid technical jargon or implementation terms
     * - Use terminology that reflects user perspective
     * - Ensure the name alone conveys the user's intent
     * - Make it understandable to non-technical stakeholders
     * - Keep consistent with user scenario description
     *
     * ## Single Endpoint Alignment
     *
     * Function names must reflect scenarios that:
     *
     * - Accomplish user goals through this single endpoint only
     * - Don't imply dependency on other API operations
     * - Represent complete user interactions
