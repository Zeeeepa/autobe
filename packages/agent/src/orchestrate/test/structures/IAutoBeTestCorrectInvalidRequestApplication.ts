  /**
   * Rewrite function to remove code containing invalid type API requests.
   *
   * This function is called when the agent detects code that attempts to send
   * API requests with deliberately wrong types, causing TypeScript compilation
   * errors. The agent will remove the problematic code sections while
   * preserving valid test code.
   *
   * Common patterns that trigger this function:
   *
   * - TestValidator.error calls testing type violations
   * - Missing required fields with type assertions
   * - Wrong type assignments with satisfies operator
   * - Nested type violations in complex objects
   * - Partial type testing with invalid structures
   *
   * The rationale for deletion:
   *
   * - Type validation is the server's responsibility, not E2E tests
   * - TypeScript compiler should enforce type safety at compile time
   * - Invalid type testing breaks the entire test suite compilation
   * - E2E tests should focus on business logic, not type system violations
   *
   * @param props - The analysis and correction properties
   * @param props.think - Analysis of what specific invalid request pattern is
   *   causing the error
   * @param props.draft - Initial corrected code with problematic sections
   *   completely removed
   * @param props.revise - Review process and final cleaned code

   * Reject function when no invalid type API requests are detected.

   * invalid API request types, indicating the agent should not intervene.
   *
   * Common scenarios for rejection:
   *
   * - Syntax errors unrelated to type violations
   * - Legitimate type mismatches that need fixing (not deletion)
   * - Framework-specific compilation issues
   * - Configuration or environment problems
   *
   * When called, this indicates that another specialized agent should handle
   * the compilation error, as it's outside this agent's domain.
