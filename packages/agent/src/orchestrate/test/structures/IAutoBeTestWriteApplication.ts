     * **Compilation & Syntax:**
     * - TypeScript compilation errors and type mismatches
     * - Syntax errors and missing semicolons/brackets
     * - Correct function signatures and parameter types
     *
     * **Framework Compliance:**
     * - @nestia/e2e framework conventions adherence
     * - Proper API SDK function calling patterns
     * - Correct use of typia.assert() and TestValidator functions
     *
     * **Business Logic & Test Coverage:**
     * - Complete workflow implementation (authentication â†’ data setup â†’ main test â†’ validation)
     * - Realistic business scenarios and user journeys
     * - Edge case handling and error condition testing
     * - Proper data dependencies and cleanup procedures
     *
     * **2. DELETE - Remove prohibited code entirely:**
     *
     * **ðŸš¨ TYPE ERROR TESTING - DELETE IMMEDIATELY ðŸš¨**
     * - DELETE any code using `as any` to send wrong types
     * - DELETE any intentional type mismatches for "testing"
     * - DELETE any missing required fields testing
     * - DELETE tests that contradict compilation requirements
     *
     * **Code Quality & Security:**
     * - Type safety violations (any, @ts-ignore, etc.) - DELETE if found
     * - Variable naming and code organization - FIX if needed
     * - Performance considerations and resource management
     * - Security best practices in test data generation
