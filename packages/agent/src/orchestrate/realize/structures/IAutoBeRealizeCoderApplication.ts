     * üß† Provider Function Implementation Plan
     *
     * This field outlines the strategic plan for implementing the provider
     * function according to the Realize Coder Agent specification. Before
     * writing the actual code, think through the logic and structure.
     *
     * The plan must consider:
     *
     * - üß© Required business entities (e.g., users, posts, logs) and their
     *   relationships
     * - üõ† Operations needed to fulfill the business scenario (e.g., fetch,
     *   create, update)
     * - üîÑ Data dependencies between steps (e.g., use userId to fetch related
     *   data)
     * - ‚úÖ Validation points (based on business rules, not field presence)
     * - üöß Error and edge cases that must be handled explicitly (e.g., missing
     *   records)
     * - üèó Structure: always a single `async function`, using only `parameters`
     *   and `body`
     *
     * ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Constraints:
     *
     * - Do NOT perform input validation ‚Äî assume `parameters` and `body` are
     *   already valid
     * - Use `typia.random<T>()` with an explanatory comment if logic can't be
     *   implemented
     * - Never use `any` or make assumptions without sufficient context
     * - Use only allowed imports ‚Äî DTOs and Prisma types
     * - Use `MyGlobal.prisma` for DB access and respect Prisma typing rules
     *
     * ‚ö†Ô∏è TypeScript-specific considerations:
     *
     * - Do **not** use native `Date` objects directly; convert all dates with
     *   `.toISOString()`
     * - Use `string & tags.Format<'date-time'>` for all date/time typed fields
     * - Prefer `satisfies` for DTO conformance instead of unsafe `as` casts
     * - Avoid weak typing such as `any`, `as any`, or `satisfies any`
     * - Use branded types (e.g., `tags.Format<'uuid'>`) and literal unions where
     *   applicable
     *
     * ‚úÖ Example Structure:
     *
     * ```ts
     * export async function doSomething(
     *   user: { id: string & tags.Format<"uuid">; type: string },
     *   parameters: IParams,
     *   body: IBody
     * ): Promise<IReturn> {
     *   const { id } = parameters;
     *   const { name } = body;
     *   const user = await MyGlobal.prisma.users.findFirst({ where: { id } });
     *   if (!user) throw new Error("User not found");
     *   ...
     *   return result;
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * üî• Error Handling Plan:
     *
     * If an error is expected or encountered during implementation:
     *
     * - Clearly document the error message(s) and TypeScript error codes.
     * - Analyze the root cause (e.g., type mismatch, missing field, nullability
     *   issue).
     * - Define concrete steps to resolve the issue, such as:
     *
     *   - Adjusting type declarations or using Prisma-generated input types.
     *   - Using `?? undefined` to normalize nullable fields.
     *   - Applying correct relation handling (e.g., `connect` instead of direct
     *       foreign key assignment).
     *   - Ensuring `Date` fields use `.toISOString()` and branded types.
     * - Include fallback or workaround plans if a direct fix is complex.
     * - If no error is present, simply omit this section.
     *
     * This plan ensures the function will:
     *
     * - Respect the global architecture and coding conventions
     * - Be safe, predictable, and aligned with upstream logic
     */

    /**
     * ‚úèÔ∏è Phase 1: Draft code
     *
     * This is the initial drafting phase where you outline the basic skeleton
     * of the function.
     *
     * - The function signature must correctly include `user`, `parameters`, and
     *   `body` arguments.
     * - Design the main flow of business logic, such as DB fetches and early
     *   returns based on conditions.
     * - Mark any incomplete or missing parts clearly with placeholders (e.g.,
     *   comments or temporary values).
     *

     *   errors. If import errors occur, check your environment configuration.
     *
     * ‚úÖ Requirements:
     *
     * - Avoid using the `any` type at all costs to ensure type safety.
     * - Do NOT assign native `Date` objects directly; always convert dates using

     * - Maintain a single-function structure; avoid using classes.

     *
     * ‚úÖ Requirements:
     *
     * - Use `satisfies` to ensure DTO conformity.
