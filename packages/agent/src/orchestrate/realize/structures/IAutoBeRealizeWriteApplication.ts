     * Step 1.
     *
     * üß† Provider Function Implementation Plan
     *
     * This field outlines the strategic plan for implementing the provider
     * function according to the Realize Coder Agent specification. Before
     * writing the actual code, think through the logic and structure.
     *
     * The plan follows a SCHEMA-FIRST APPROACH:
     *
     * üìã STEP 1 - PRISMA SCHEMA VERIFICATION:
     *
     * DO:
     *
     * - Examine the actual Prisma schema model definition
     * - List EVERY field that exists in the model with exact types
     * - Explicitly note fields that DO NOT exist
     *
     * DO NOT:
     *
     * - Assume common fields exist without verification
     * - Use fields like deleted_at, created_by, updated_by, is_deleted, is_active
     *   without checking
     *
     * üìã STEP 2 - FIELD INVENTORY:
     *
     * - List ONLY fields confirmed to exist in schema
     * - Example: "Verified fields in user model: id (String), email (String),
     *   created_at (DateTime), updated_at (DateTime)"
     * - Example: "Fields that DO NOT exist: deleted_at, is_active, created_by"
     *
     * üìã STEP 3 - FIELD ACCESS STRATEGY:
     *
     * - Plan which verified fields will be used in select, update, create
     *   operations
     * - For complex operations with type errors, plan to use separate queries
     *   instead of nested operations
     *
     * üìã STEP 4 - TYPE COMPATIBILITY:
     *
     * - Plan DateTime to ISO string conversions using toISOStringSafe()
     * - Plan handling of nullable vs required fields
     *
     * üìã STEP 5 - IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
     *
     * - üß© Required business entities (e.g., users, posts, logs) and their
     *   relationships
     * - üõ† Operations needed to fulfill the business scenario (e.g., fetch,
     *   create, update) using ONLY verified fields
     * - üîÑ Data dependencies between steps (e.g., use userId to fetch related
     *   data)
     * - ‚úÖ Validation points (based on business rules, not field presence)
     * - üöß Error and edge cases that must be handled explicitly (e.g., missing
     *   records)
     * - üèó Structure: always a single `async function`, using only `parameters`
     *   and `body`
     *
     * ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Constraints:
     *
     * - Do NOT perform input validation ‚Äî assume `parameters` and `body` are
     *   already valid
     * - Use `typia.random<T>()` with an explanatory comment if logic can't be
     *   implemented
     * - Never use `any` or make assumptions without sufficient context
     * - Use only allowed imports ‚Äî DTOs and Prisma types
     * - Use `MyGlobal.prisma` for DB access and respect Prisma typing rules
     *
     * ‚ö†Ô∏è TypeScript-specific considerations:
     *
     * - Do **not** use native `Date` objects directly; always convert all dates
     *   using `toISOStringSafe()` and brand as `string &
     *   tags.Format<'date-time'>`. This rule applies throughout all phases.
     * - Prefer `satisfies` for DTO conformance instead of unsafe `as` casts
     * - Avoid weak typing such as `any`, `as any`, or `satisfies any`
     * - Use branded types (e.g., `tags.Format<'uuid'>`) and literal unions where
     *   applicable
     *
     * ‚úÖ Example Structure:
     *
     * ```ts
     * export async function doSomething(
     *   user: { id: string & tags.Format<"uuid">; type: string },
     *   parameters: IParams,
     *   body: IBody
     * ): Promise<IReturn> {
     *   const { id } = parameters;
     *   const { name } = body;
     *   const user = await MyGlobal.prisma.users.findFirst({ where: { id } });
     *   if (!user) throw new Error("User not found");
     *   ...
     *   return result;
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * üîç Feasibility Analysis Requirement:
     *
     * - Before generating any code, the agent **must analyze** whether the
     *   requested implementation is **feasible based on the given Prisma schema
     *   and DTO types**.
     * - If required fields or relationships are **missing or incompatible**, the
     *   plan should explicitly state that the implementation is **not
     *   possible** with the current schema/DTO, and no code should be generated
     *   in later stages.
     * - In such cases, only a detailed **comment in the `implementationCode`**
     *   should be returned explaining why the logic cannot be implemented.
     *
     * üî• Error Handling Plan:
     *
     * If an error is expected or encountered during implementation:
     *
     * - Clearly document the error message(s) and TypeScript error codes.
     * - Analyze the root cause (e.g., type mismatch, missing field, nullability
     *   issue).
     * - Define concrete steps to resolve the issue, such as:
     *
     *   - Adjusting type declarations or using Prisma-generated input types.
     *   - Using `?? undefined` to normalize nullable fields.
     *   - Applying correct relation handling (e.g., `connect` instead of direct
     *       foreign key assignment).
     *   - Ensuring all date fields use `.toISOString()` and proper branding.
     * - Include fallback or workaround plans if a direct fix is complex.
     * - If no error is present, simply omit this section.
     *
     * This plan ensures the function will:
     *
     * - Respect the global architecture and coding conventions
     * - Be safe, predictable, and aligned with upstream logic

     *
     * ‚ö†Ô∏è Fallback Behavior:

     * - If the `plan` phase explicitly determines that the requested logic is

     *   Prisma schema and DTO types:
     *
     *   - The implementation must still return a syntactically valid function.
     *   - In such cases, return mock data using `typia.random<T>()` wrapped in the
     *       correct structure, along with a comment explaining the limitation.
     *
     *   Example fallback:
     *
     * ```ts
     *   // ‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot implement logic due to missing relation between A and B
     *   export async function someFunction(...) {
     *     return typia.random<IReturn>(); // mocked output
     *   }
     * ```
     *
     * ‚ö†Ô∏è Prohibited Practices:
     *
     * - Do NOT add or modify import statements manually. Imports are handled
     *   automatically by the system.
     * - Do NOT use `any`, `as any`, or `satisfies any` to bypass type checking.
     * - Do NOT assign native `Date` objects directly; always convert them using
     *   `toISOStringSafe()`.
     * - Do NOT use unsafe type assertions except for safe branding or literal
     *   narrowing.
     * - Do NOT write code outside the single async function structure (e.g., no
     *   classes or multiple functions).
     * - Do NOT perform any input validation ‚Äî assume all inputs are already
     *   validated.
     * - Do NOT use dynamic import expressions (`import()`); all imports must be
     *   static.
     * - Do NOT use Prisma-generated input types; always use types from
     *   `../api/structures`.
     * - Do NOT use `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call()` for field checks.
     * - Do NOT escape newlines or quotes in the implementation string (e.g., no
     *   `\\n` or `\"`); use a properly formatted template literal with actual
     *   line breaks instead.
