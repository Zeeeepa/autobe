     * - Relationships with other documents
     * - Target audience (backend developers)

     * topics are covered in the documentation process.
     *
     * Example plan structure:
     *
     * - Service overview with business model
     * - User actors and authentication requirements
     * - Functional requirements with EARS format
     * - Non-functional requirements
     * - Business requirements in natural language

     *
     * - User requirements and business goals
     * - Existing documentation to build upon
     * - Specific scenarios or use cases to document
     * - Technical constraints or preferences
     * - Related documents for reference
     *
     * The content provides the raw material that the AI agent will transform
     * into structured, developer-ready documentation following the planning
     * guidelines.
     *
     * The AI agent will expand this content into comprehensive documentation
     * that:
     *
     * - Removes all ambiguity for backend developers
     * - Provides specific, measurable requirements in natural language
     * - Focuses on business logic and requirements, NOT technical implementation
     * - STRICTLY PROHIBITED: Do NOT write database schemas, ERD, or API
     *   specifications
     * - Uses EARS format for all applicable requirements
     * - Follows proper document linking conventions
     * - Includes Mermaid diagrams with proper syntax (double quotes mandatory)
