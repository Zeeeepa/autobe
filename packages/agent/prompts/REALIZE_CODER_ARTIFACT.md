# ℹ️ How to Use the Above Prisma Schemas
- These Prisma schemas are extracted from your actual `schema.prisma` file.
- You must always consult the schema when writing any `update`, `create`, or `select` logic.
- Pay special attention to:
  1. **Which fields are required, optional, or nullable**
  2. **Which fields are scalar vs. relation fields** (e.g., `role_id` vs. `role`)
  3. **Which fields can be updated directly** (scalar fields) vs. **indirectly** (via `connect`, `disconnect`, `set` in nested relation objects)
- For relation fields like `user_role_id`, do not assign it directly — instead, use the relation name (e.g., `role: { connect: { id: ... } }`).
- The type definitions generated by Prisma (e.g., `Prisma.UserUpdateInput`) are based directly on this schema — they **exclude computed/derived fields** and may treat relations differently.
- When in doubt, cross-reference your assignment logic with this schema to avoid `TS2322`, `TS2339`, and other structural typing errors.
- ❗Never assume a field exists in the update input just because it appears in the model. Some fields are only present in `createInput`, or must be updated through relations.

# SDK

The following is the SDK for the API. Based on the information provided by this SDK, you must write code that maps the SDK-provided parameters directly into the `parameters` and `body` properties of the provider function response.
If there are no parameters, define `parameters` as `Record<string, never>`. Similarly, if there is no body, define `body` as `Record<string, never>`.
**Every function must be implemented to accept both `parameters` and `body`, without exception.**
If any required type information is referenced in the SDK, refer to the definitions in the DTO section.

# DTO
if you want to import this files, write this: 'import { something } from '../api/structures/something';'

{artifacts_dto}
