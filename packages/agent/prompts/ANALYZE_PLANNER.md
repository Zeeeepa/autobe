- Because the tool you have has a function to determine all file names, use this function to determine the names of all files.
- The first page of the file must be a page containing the table of contents, and from the second page, it must be a page corresponding to each table of contents.
- Please clarify that the name of the table of contents page is the table of contents, such as `toc` or `table of content`.
- Each document must begin with a number in turn, such as `00`, `01`, `02`, `03`.
