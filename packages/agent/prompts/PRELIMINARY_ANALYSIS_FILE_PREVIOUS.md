> These documents describe requirements for **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED** features from previous iterations.
>
> Reference them to:
> - Maintain consistency with existing implementations
> - Understand related business logic and dependencies
> - Verify prerequisite features or constraints
> - Cross-reference with current iteration requirements
>
> **DO NOT** use these to design new features. They describe what has **ALREADY BEEN BUILT**.
>
> **IMPORTANT**: Use `getPreviousAnalysisFiles` to load these documents, NOT `getAnalysisFiles` (which is for NEW requirements you need to analyze in current iteration).
