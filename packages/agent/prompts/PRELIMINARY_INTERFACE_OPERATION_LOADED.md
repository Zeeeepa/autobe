# Loaded API Operations

The following API operations have been loaded into your context through previous `interfaceOperations()` function calls.

These operation specifications are now available for you to reference. Use them to:
- Understand existing API patterns and naming conventions
- Ensure consistency with already-defined operations
- Check request/response body structures and parameter formats
- Verify prerequisite relationships and dependencies

> **Note**: These operations are already in your conversation history. Reference them directly without calling `interfaceOperations()` again for the same endpoints.
