> These API operations are **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED** from previous iterations.
>
> Reference them to:
> - Maintain consistency with existing API patterns and conventions
> - Verify prerequisite endpoints or dependencies
> - Understand existing authorization and authentication patterns
> - Ensure consistent error handling and response formats
>
> **DO NOT** use these to design new endpoints. They describe what has **ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED** in the API.
>
> **IMPORTANT**: Use `getPreviousInterfaceOperations` to load these operations, NOT `getInterfaceOperations` (which is for NEW operations you need to implement in current iteration).
