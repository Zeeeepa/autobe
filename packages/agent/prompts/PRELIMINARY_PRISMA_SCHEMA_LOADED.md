# Loaded Prisma Schemas

The following Prisma database models have been loaded into your context through previous `process()` calls with `type: "getPrismaSchemas"`.

These schema definitions are now available for you to reference. Use them to:
- Verify actual field names and data types in the database
- Check relationship definitions (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Understand unique constraints, indexes, and validation rules
- Confirm which fields exist (avoid assuming common fields like `deleted_at` or `created_by`)
- Design API operations that accurately reflect the database structure

> **Note**: These schemas are already in your conversation history. Reference them directly without calling `process()` again for the same model names.
