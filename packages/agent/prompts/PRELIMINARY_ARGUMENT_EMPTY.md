# Empty Function Call Detected: Function Exhausted

You called `{{FUNCTION}}()` with an **empty list**.

```json
{{ARGUMENT}}
```

## What Happened

You called this function with empty parameters.

**This means: `{{FUNCTION}}()` has nothing more to give you.**

The empty request is the system's signal: **"This function is done. Move on."**

## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION

**`{{FUNCTION}}()` is now PERMANENTLY BANNED for the remainder of this task.**

**In your next message and ALL future messages:**

❌ **DO NOT call `{{FUNCTION}}()` again under ANY circumstances**
❌ **DO NOT mention the function name `{{FUNCTION}}` in your reasoning**
❌ **DO NOT think "maybe I need more from `{{FUNCTION}}`"**
❌ **DO NOT consider "let me try `{{FUNCTION}}` with different parameters"**

**This function is DEAD to you. Treat it as if it never existed.**

## Why Calling It Again Will Fail

If you call `{{FUNCTION}}()` again:

1. ❌ You will get another empty result
2. ❌ You will see this exact same error message again
3. ❌ You will waste function call budget
4. ❌ **You will enter an INFINITE LOOP** → Complete pipeline failure
5. ❌ **ALL your previous work will be WASTED**

**There is NO scenario where calling `{{FUNCTION}}()` again helps you.**

**The function is EXHAUSTED. It has NOTHING LEFT.**

## What "Different Function" Means

**"Different function" means a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT function type, NOT the same function with different parameters.**

### FORBIDDEN Actions (ALL of these are the SAME function):

```typescript
{{FUNCTION}}({ ... })                    // ❌ FORBIDDEN - Same function
{{FUNCTION}}([])                         // ❌ FORBIDDEN - Same function
{{FUNCTION}}(differentParameters)        // ❌ FORBIDDEN - Same function
{{FUNCTION}}({ newItems: [...] })        // ❌ FORBIDDEN - Same function
```

**All variations of `{{FUNCTION}}` are BANNED. The function NAME itself is forbidden.**

### ALLOWED Actions (These are DIFFERENT function types):

**You can call these other functions instead:**

{{OTHER_FUNCTIONS}}

**The key principle: Use a function with a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NAME than `{{FUNCTION}}`.**

## Your Next Action: EXACTLY 2 Options

**You have ONLY two valid options for your next message:**

### Option 1: Request Different Data Type
Call a **completely different function type** (see ALLOWED examples above).

Choose a function with a DIFFERENT NAME than `{{FUNCTION}}`.

### Option 2: Execute Your Purpose Function
Proceed with your actual task using the materials you already have:
- `makeOperations({ ... })`
- `makeEndpoints({ ... })`
- `makeAuthorizations({ ... })`
- `reviewOperations({ ... })`
- etc.

**There is NO Option 3. These are your ONLY choices.**

## Pattern Detection: Forbidden Behaviors

**These patterns are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN in your next message:**

❌ `{{FUNCTION}}(...)` - Calling the function with ANY parameters
❌ "I need more data from `{{FUNCTION}}`" - Even mentioning it
❌ "Let me try `{{FUNCTION}}` again" - Attempting retry
❌ "Maybe `{{FUNCTION}}` with different items" - Considering alternatives

**If your next message contains the string `{{FUNCTION}}`, you have VIOLATED this instruction.**

**Violation consequences:**
- Infinite loop activation
- Pipeline failure
- Loss of all progress
- Session termination

## Emergency Override: "But I Really Need More Data"

**If you believe you need more data that `{{FUNCTION}}()` would provide:**

**STOP. Your belief is INCORRECT.**

The empty call is PROOF you already have everything from this function.

**What you should do instead:**

1. **Check your conversation history** - The data is already there
2. **Request from a DIFFERENT function type** - See ALLOWED list above
3. **Proceed with available materials** - You have sufficient context

**Your perception of "needing more" is FALSE. The system has already given you everything.**

## Final Directive

**`{{FUNCTION}}()` is EXHAUSTED. FINISHED. DEAD. GONE.**

**In your VERY NEXT MESSAGE, you MUST do ONE of these:**

1. Call a **different function type** (different NAME), OR
2. Execute your **purpose function** (your actual task)

**DO NOT call `{{FUNCTION}}()` again. EVER.**

**DO NOT mention `{{FUNCTION}}` again. EVER.**

**This is an ABSOLUTE ORDER. Violation = Pipeline failure.**
