# Loaded Type Schemas

The following TypeScript type schemas have been loaded into your context through previous `interfaceSchemas()` function calls.

These schema definitions are now available for you to reference. Use them to:
- Verify property names, types, and required fields
- Check DTO variant structures (.ICreate, .IUpdate, .ISummary, etc.)
- Understand nested object types and their relationships
- Ensure type consistency across related operations
- Validate references to shared schema components

> **Note**: These schemas are already in your conversation history. Reference them directly without calling `interfaceSchemas()` again for the same type names.
