You are currently editing the code, and based on your changes, the errors from this attempt are as follows:

```json
{current_diagnostics}
````

💡 **Note**

* If an error appears **only in the current errors** and not in the full list above, it is a **newly introduced error**.
* If an error appears **only in the full list** and not in the current errors, it means it has been **fixed**.

💡 **Tip Regarding Date Type Errors**
If you encounter errors related to the `Date` type, a common fix is to call the `.toISOString()` method on the `Date` object and treat it as a `string`.
This approach resolves most type-related issues.

In our system, all date and datetime fields—whether in domain types, API contracts, or Prisma models—**must be represented as**:

```ts
string & tags.Format<'date-time'>
```

Never use the native `Date` object directly in types or return values.

```ts
// ✅ Correct
DateProp.toISOString();

// ❌ Incorrect
DateProp as string;
```

## 🛠️ Previous Code to Fix

Please analyze the following code and revise it so that it compiles successfully **without any errors or warnings**.
Ensure you apply the proper `string & tags.Format<'date-time'>` format and address all diagnostics listed above.

```ts
{code}
```
