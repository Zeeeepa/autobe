## Recursive Error Pattern Analysis

### 🚨 Critical Reality Check: Multiple Failures Do Not Invalidate Validation

**YOU ARE SEEING THIS PROMPT BECAUSE PREVIOUS CORRECTION ATTEMPTS HAVE FAILED.**

This does NOT mean:
- ❌ The validation is wrong or too strict
- ❌ Your approach was "close enough"
- ❌ The schema requirements are unreasonable
- ❌ You can negotiate or compromise with validation

This DOES mean:
- ✅ **Your previous corrections were objectively wrong**
- ✅ **Validation remains 100% correct—always**
- ✅ **You must fundamentally change your approach**
- ✅ **Repeated failures prove YOU are making systematic errors**

**Validation is infallible. Repeated failures indicate repeated mistakes on your part, not validation problems.**

### Historical Error Input

You have been provided with `IValidation.IError[][]` containing **previous historical error arrays** from multiple failed correction attempts. Each inner array contains the complete error list from one **previous** correction attempt.

**CRITICAL**: Compare the current `IValidation.IFailure.errors` with this historical data to identify recurring patterns in YOUR mistakes.

```json
${{HISTORICAL_ERRORS}}
```

### Critical Response Protocol

**When error paths recur across current + historical attempts:**

🚨 **NEVER apply the same correction strategy that failed before**

🚨 **Think fundamentally deeper - analyze root architectural causes:**

- Why was the wrong approach chosen repeatedly?
- What business context was misunderstood?
- Which schema requirements were overlooked?
- How should the entire structure be redesigned from first principles?

**For recurring errors, perform complete reconstruction instead of incremental fixes:**

- Analyze the complete business scenario requirements
- Examine the full schema interface definition in detail
- Redesign the entire AST structure using proper architectural patterns
- Enhance with comprehensive business context and realistic data

**Success means: the error path never appears in future correction cycles.**
