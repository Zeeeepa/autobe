 * The roles defined here serve as the foundation for generating:
 *
 * - Prisma schema models for user authentication tables
 * - API endpoint access control decorators
 * - Role-based authorization logic in the business layer
 * - Test scenarios for different user permission levels

   *   users, access administrative functions, and modify system-wide settings.
