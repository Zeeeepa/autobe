/**
 * Authorization decorator implementation for role-based access control.
 *
 * This interface represents a custom TypeScript decorator that can be applied
 * to NestJS controllers, routes, or methods to enforce authorization policies.
 * The decorator integrates with NestJS's guard system and metadata reflection
 * to protect endpoints based on user roles and permissions.
 *
 * Generated decorators are role-specific and include domain-specific names like
 *
 * @author Michael
 * @ShoppingCustomerAuth(), @BbsModeratorAuth(), @AdminAuth(), or other custom
 * decorators that work in conjunction with authorization guards to validate
 * user access before executing protected operations.
