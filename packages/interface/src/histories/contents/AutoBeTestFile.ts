 * Represents a single test file generated by the Test agent with comprehensive

 * about the test's purpose, target API endpoints, and expected behavior
 * patterns, enabling better test organization, maintenance, and programmatic
 * manipulation.
 *
 * The workflow follows a clear progression: AST definition → TypeScript code
 * generation → executable test file, allowing for sophisticated analysis,
 * transformation, and code generation workflows.
