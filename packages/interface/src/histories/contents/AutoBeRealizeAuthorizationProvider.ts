/**
 * Authorization provider implementation for runtime access control.
 *
 * This interface represents a NestJS provider that implements the core
 * authorization logic for the application. Providers include guards,
 * strategies, services, and other injectable classes that work together to
 * validate user permissions and enforce access control policies at runtime.
 *
 * Common provider types include:
 *
 * - Guards: Validate requests before reaching route handlers
 * - Strategies: Implement authentication protocols (JWT, OAuth, etc.)
 * - Services: Provide authorization business logic and user validation
 * - Middleware: Pre-process requests for authorization context
