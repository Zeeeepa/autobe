/**
 * Event fired when the Prisma agent generates a complete schema file for a
 * specific business domain during the database design process.
 *
 * This event occurs when the Prisma agent has successfully designed and
 * generated all database tables for a particular business domain (e.g., Sales,
 * Orders, Users). The agent follows a systematic 2-step process: strategic
 * planning (plan) and model generation (models), producing production-ready
 * database schemas that maintain data integrity and business logic accuracy.
 * The generated models will be reviewed by a separate review agent.
 *
 * Each schema file represents a cohesive unit of database design focused on a
 * specific business area, following domain-driven design principles. The
 * progressive completion of schema files provides real-time visibility into the
 * database architecture development, enabling stakeholders to track progress
 * and validate domain-specific data models incrementally.
