/**
 * Event fired during the writing phase of the requirements analysis process.
 *
 * This event represents the core activity of the Analyze Writer Agent
 * (PlannerAgent), which serves as AutoBE's requirements analysis specialist.
 * The agent transforms user requirements and business objectives into
 * comprehensive, developer-ready documentation following the WHY → WHAT → HOW
 * framework.
 *
 * The Analyze Writer Agent operates as the first critical step in AutoBE's
 * waterfall development model, producing structured markdown documents that
 * include:
 *
 * - Business models and user actors
 * - Functional requirements in EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format
 * - API endpoint specifications (as guidance, not prescriptive)
 * - Entity relationship diagrams (ERD)
 * - Security and business logic requirements
 *
 * Key characteristics of the writing process:
 *
 * - Focuses exclusively on backend requirements (no frontend/UI specifications)
 * - Produces documents ranging from 2,000 to 30,000+ characters
 * - Avoids ambiguous terms and maintains clear, measurable requirements
 * - Excludes implementation details to preserve developer autonomy
 *
 * The generated documents serve as the foundation for subsequent AutoBE agents:
 * Prisma Agent (database design), Interface Agent (API design), Test Agent
 * (test generation), and Realize Agent (implementation).
 *
 * For detailed information about the Analyze Writer Agent's behavior and
 * requirements, refer to packages/agent/prompts/ANALYZE_WRITE.md
