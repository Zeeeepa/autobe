/**
 * Event fired when an AI agent's function call output fails JSON parsing.
 *
 * This event occurs when an AI agent returns structured data through function
 * calling that cannot be successfully parsed as valid JSON. This typically
 * indicates malformed JSON syntax such as missing quotes, trailing commas,
 * unclosed brackets, or other syntax violations that prevent the parser from
 * interpreting the response.
 *
 * JSON parse errors are distinguished from validation errors - this event
 * represents syntactic failures (invalid JSON structure) rather than semantic
 * failures (valid JSON with incorrect schema). When this error occurs, the
 * agent's response cannot be processed at all, requiring regeneration of the
 * entire response with proper JSON formatting.
 *
 * The event captures comprehensive diagnostic information including the source
 * agent, function name, raw arguments that failed to parse, and the specific
 * error message from the JSON parser, enabling effective debugging and
 * self-healing through the correction loop mechanism.
