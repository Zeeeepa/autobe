/**
 * Event emitted when DTO type names are validated and refactored for naming compliance.
 *
 * This event is dispatched during the Interface phase when the Schema Rename agent
 * analyzes existing DTO type names against Prisma table names to detect violations
 * of the critical naming convention: ALL words from the Prisma table name MUST be
 * preserved in the DTO type name.
 *
 * The agent identifies type names that incorrectly omit service prefixes or
 * intermediate components and provides refactoring operations to fix them.
 *
 * Common violations detected:
 * - Service prefix omission: `ISale` should be `IShoppingSale`
 * - Intermediate word omission: `IBbsComment` should be `IBbsArticleComment`
 * - Multiple words omitted: `IShoppingRefund` should be `IShoppingOrderGoodRefund`
 *
 * The orchestrator automatically applies these refactorings to:
 * - Base types (e.g., `ISale`)
 * - All variants (e.g., `ISale.ICreate`, `ISale.IUpdate`, `ISale.ISummary`)
 * - Page types (e.g., `IPageISale`)
 * - All `$ref` references throughout the OpenAPI document
 *
 * @see AutoBeInterfaceSchemaRefactor for individual refactoring operations
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * {
 *   type: "interfaceSchemaRename",
 *   id: "uuid-v7",
 *   refactors: [
 *     { from: "ISale", to: "IShoppingSale" },
 *     { from: "IBbsComment", to: "IBbsArticleComment" }
 *   ],
 *   total: 100,
 *   completed: 50,
 *   tokenUsage: { input: 1000, output: 200 },
 *   created_at: "2025-01-23T12:34:56.789Z"
 * }
 * ```
