/**
 * AST type system for programmatic E2E test function generation through AI
 * function calling.
 *
 * This namespace defines a comprehensive Abstract Syntax Tree structure that
 * enables AI agents to construct complete E2E test functions at the AST level.
 * Each type corresponds to specific TypeScript language constructs, allowing
 * precise control over generated test code while maintaining type safety and
 * business logic accuracy.
 *
 * ## Core Purpose
 *
 * The system is designed for systematic generation where AI function calls
 * build test scenarios step-by-step, mapping business requirements to
 * executable code. Instead of generating raw TypeScript strings, AI agents
 * construct structured AST objects that represent:
 *
 * - Complete test function flows with proper data dependencies
 * - Realistic API call sequences with captured responses
 * - Comprehensive validation using TestValidator assertions
 * - Complex business logic with conditional flows and error handling
 *
 * ## Architecture Overview
 *
 * - **IFunction**: Root container representing complete test functions
 * - **Statements**: Building blocks for test logic (API operations, expressions,
 *   conditionals)
 * - **Expressions**: Value computations, API calls, data access, and validations
 * - **Literals**: Direct values for realistic business data
 * - **Random Generators**: Dynamic test data creation with business constraints
 * - **Predicates**: TestValidator assertions for comprehensive validation
 *
 * ## Business Context
 *
 * In E2E testing, this typically maps to complete business scenarios like:
 *
 * - Customer purchase workflows (registration ‚Üí product selection ‚Üí payment ‚Üí
 *   confirmation)
 * - Seller product management (authentication ‚Üí product creation ‚Üí inventory
 *   management)
 * - Multi-role interactions (seller creates product ‚Üí customer purchases ‚Üí admin
 *   processes)
 *
 * Each generated function represents a realistic business workflow with proper
 * data flow, where API responses from earlier steps provide inputs for
 * subsequent operations, creating authentic test scenarios that mirror
 * real-world application usage.

   * workflows through AI function calling.
   *
   * The generation process follows a three-stage approach: planning, drafting,
   * and AST construction. This ensures that AI agents create well-structured,
   * comprehensive test functions through deliberate design phases.
   *
   * In the context of E2E testing, this typically maps to complete business
   * scenarios like "customer purchase flow" or "seller product management",

     *
     * 1. **Path Parameters**: Each parameter from

     *
     *    - Property name: `AutoBeOpenApi.IParameter.name`
     *    - Property value: Expression matching `AutoBeOpenApi.IParameter.schema`
     *    - Example: `{ saleId: "uuid-string", customerId: "another-uuid" }`
     * 2. **Request Body**: If `AutoBeOpenApi.IOperation.requestBody` exists:
     *
     *    - Add a `body` property containing the request body data
     *    - Value type: Object literal matching the requestBody's typeName schema
     *    - Example: `{ body: { name: "Product Name", price: 99.99 } }`
     * 3. **Combined Structure**: When both path parameters and request body exist:
     *
     *    ```typescript
     *    {
     *      // Path parameters as individual properties
     *      "saleId": "uuid-value",
     *      "customerId": "another-uuid",
     *      // Request body as 'body' property
     *      "body": {
     *        "name": "Updated Product",
     *        "price": 149.99,
     *        "description": "Enhanced product description"
     *      }
     *    }
     *    ```
     *
     * **Special Cases:**
     *
     * - **No Parameters**: When `parameters` is empty array AND `requestBody` is
     *   null, set this to `null` (the API function requires no arguments)
     * - **Only Path Parameters**: When `requestBody` is null but `parameters`
     *   exist, create object with only path parameter properties
     * - **Only Request Body**: When `parameters` is empty but `requestBody`
     *   exists, create object with only the `body` property
     *
     * **AI Construction Strategy:**
     *
     * 1. Analyze the target `AutoBeOpenApi.IOperation` specification
     * 2. Extract all path parameters and create corresponding object properties
     * 3. If request body exists, add it as the `body` property
     * 4. Ensure all property values match the expected types from OpenAPI schema
     * 5. Use realistic business data that reflects actual API usage patterns
     *
     * **Type Safety Requirements:**
     *
     * - Path parameter values must match their schema types (string, integer,
     *   etc.)
     * - Request body structure must exactly match the referenced schema type
     * - All required properties must be included with valid values
     * - Optional properties can be omitted or included based on test scenario
     *   needs
     *
     * **Business Context Examples:**
     *
     * ```typescript
     * // GET /customers/{customerId}/orders/{orderId} (no request body)
     * {
     *   customerId: "cust-123",
